# Welcome {-}




This online book captures the information in my [blog](https://daniellakens.blogspot.com/), the educational information in my MOOCs [Improving Your Statistical Inferences](https://www.coursera.org/learn/statistical-inferences) and [Improving Your Statistical Questions](https://www.coursera.org/learn/improving-statistical-questions), and my [scientific work](https://scholar.google.nl/citations?user=ZbqYyrsAAAAJ&hl=en) in one place. The goal is to make the information easier to find, more accessible to users, and present the most up to date information based on progressive insights, recent scientific developments, and new statistical software.
