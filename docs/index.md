# Welcome {-}




This open educational resource integrates information from my [blog](https://daniellakens.blogspot.com/), my MOOCs [Improving Your Statistical Inferences](https://www.coursera.org/learn/statistical-inferences) and [Improving Your Statistical Questions](https://www.coursera.org/learn/improving-statistical-questions), and my [scientific work](https://scholar.google.nl/citations?user=ZbqYyrsAAAAJ&hl=en) in one place. The goal is to make the information findable, accessible, and make it easier to update the material based on recent scientific developments and new statistical software.
