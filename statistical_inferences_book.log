[]\TU/SourceCodePro(0)/m/n/10 When you find *p* > 0.05, you did not observe surprising data, assuming there is no true effect. You can often read in the literature how *p* > 0.05 is interpreted as ‘no effect’ but due to a lack of power the data might not be surprising if there was an effect. In this blog I’ll explain how to test for equivalence, or the lack of a meaningful effect, using equivalence hypothesis testing. I’ve created easy to use R functions that allow you to perform equivalence hypothesis tests. Warning: If you read beyond this paragraph, you will never again be able to write “as predicted, the interaction revealed there was an effect for participants in the experimental condition (p < 0.05) but there was no effect in the control condition (F < 1).” If you prefer the veil of ignorance, here’s a nice site with cute baby animals to spend the next 9 minutes on instead.[]

[]\TU/SourceCodePro(0)/m/n/10 So why were we not using these tests in the psychological literature? It’s the same old, same old. Your statistics teacher didn’t tell you about them. SPSS doesn’t allow you to do an equivalence test. Your editors and reviewers were always OK with your statements such as “as predicted, the interaction revealed there was an effect for participants in the experimental condition (p < 0.05) but there was no effect in the control condition (F < 1).” Well, I just ruined that for you. Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence![] 
 []

[]\TU/SourceCodePro(0)/m/n/10 We can’t use p > 0.05 as evidence of a lack of an effect. You can switch to Bayesian statistics if you want to support the null, but the default priors are only useful of in research areas where very large effects are examined (e.g., some areas of cognitive psychology), and are not appropriate for most other areas in psychology, so you will have to be able to quantify your prior belief yourself. You can teach yourself how, but there might be researchers who prefer to provide support for the lack of an effect within a Frequentist framework. Given that most people think about the effect size they expect when designing their study, defining the SESOI at this moment is straightforward. After choosing the SESOI, you can even design your study to have sufficient power to reject the presence of a meaningful effect. Controlling your error rates is thus straightforward in equivalence hypothesis tests, while it is not that easy in Bayesian statistics (although it can be done through simulations).[] 
 []


Overfull \hbox (3555.07965pt too wide) in paragraph at lines 1951--1951
[]\TU/SourceCodePro(0)/m/n/10 One thing I noticed while reading this literature is that TOST procedures, and power analyses for TOST, are not created to match the way psychologists design studies and think about meaningful effects. In medicine, equivalence is based on the raw data (a decrease of 10% compared to the default medicine), while we are more used to think in terms of standardized effect sizes (correlations or Cohen’s d). Biostatisticians are fine with estimating the pooled standard deviation for a future study when performing power analysis for TOST, but psychologists use standardized effect sizes to perform power analyses. Finally, the packages that exist in R (e.g., equivalence) or the software that does equivalence hypothesis tests (e.g., Minitab, which has TOST for t-

In my experience (Lakens, 2013) researchers find it easier to use their own preferred software to handle their data, and then calculate additional statistics not provided by the software they use by typing in summary statistics in a spreadsheet (means, standard deviations, and sample sizes per condition). So my functions don’t require access to the raw data (which is good for reviewers as well). Finally, the functions make a nice picture such as the one above so you can see what you are doing.[]

In Bayesian estimation, one way to argue for the absence of a meaningful effect is the Region of Practical Equivalence (ROPE) procedure (Kruschke, 2014, chapter 12), which is “somewhat analogous to frequentist equivalence testing” (Kruschke & Liddell, 2017).[]

[]\TU/SourceCodePro(0)/m/n/10 In the ROPE procedure, a 95% Highest Density Interval (HDI) is calculated based on a posterior distribution (which is calculated based on a prior and the data). Kruschke suggests that: “if the 95 % HDI falls entirely inside the ROPE then we decide to accept the ROPE’d value for practical purposes”. Note that the same HDI can also be used to reject the null hypothesis, where in Frequentist statistics, even though the confidence interval plays a similar role, you would still perform both a traditional t-

Overfull \hbox (3766.98846pt too wide) in paragraph at lines 1951--1951
[]\TU/SourceCodePro(0)/m/n/10 The only real difference with equivalence testing is that instead of using a confidence interval, a Bayesian Highest Density Interval is used. If the prior used by Kruschke was perfectly uniform, ROPE and equivalence testing would identical, barring philosophical differences in how the numbers should be interpreted. The BEST package by default uses a ‘broad’ prior, and therefore the 95% CI and 95% HDI are not exactly the same, but they are very close, for single comparisons. When multiple comparisons are made, (for example when using sequential analyses, Lakens, 2014), the CI needs to be adjusted to maintain the desired error rate, but in Bayesian statistics, error rates are not directly controlled (they are limited due to ‘shrinkage’, but can be inflated beyond 5%, and often considerably so).[]

[]\TU/SourceCodePro(0)/m/n/10 Kruschke (2014, Chapter 5) writes: “How should we define “reasonably credible”? One way is by saying that any points within the 95% HDI are reasonably credible.” There is not a strong justification for the use of a 95% HDI over a 96% of 93% HDI, except that it mirrors the familiar use of a 95% CI in Frequentist statistics. In Frequentist statistics, the 95% confidence interval is directly related to the 5% alpha level that is commonly deemed acceptable for a maximum Type 1 error rate (even though this alpha level is in itself a convention without strong justification).[]

[]\TU/SourceCodePro(0)/m/n/10 This nicely illustrates the difference between estimation (where you just want to have a certain level of accuracy, such as 95%), and Frequentist hypothesis testing, where you want to distinguish between signal and noise, and not be wrong more than 5% of the time when you declare there is a signal. ROPE keeps the accuracy the same across tests, Frequentist approaches keep the error rate constant. From a Frequentist perspective, ROPE is more conservative than TOST, like the use of alpha = 0.025 is more conservative than the use of alpha = 0.05.[]

[]\TU/SourceCodePro(0)/m/n/10 Because the BESTpower function relies on simulations, you need to specify the sample size, and it will calculate the power. That’s actually the reverse of what you typically want in a power analysis (you want to input the desired power, and see which sample size you need). This means you most likely need to run multiple simulations in BESTpower, before you have determined the sample size that will yield good power. Furthermore, the software requires your to specify the expected means and standard deviations, instead of simply an expected effect size. Instead of Frequentist power analysis, where the hypothesized effect size is a point value (e.g., d = 0.4), Bayesian power analysis models the alternative as a distribution, acknowledging there is uncertainty.[]

\TU/SourceCodePro(0)/m/n/10 analysis. If you draw small samples from a population, the mean and standard deviation in the sample can differ considerably from the mean and standard deviation in the population. There is great variability in small samples. Parameter estimates from small samples are very imprecise, and therefore the 95% confidence intervals around effect sizes are very wide. Indeed, this led Cohen (1994) to write “I suspect that the main reason [confidence intervals] are not reported is that they are so embarrassingly large!” If we want a more precise estimate of our parameter of interest, such as the mean difference or correlation in the population, we need either run extremely large single studies, or alternatively, combine data from several studies by performing a **meta-
