<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Why you don’t need to adjust your alpha level for all tests you’ll do in your lifetime.</h2>
<p>The main goal in a Neyman-Pearson approach is to develop a procedure that that will guide behavior, without being wrong too often. The long-run error rate of the decisions you make (based on the p-values you calculate) is easily controlled at a specific alpha level when only a single statistical test is performed. When multiple tests are performed, one can’t simply use the overall alpha level for all performed tests. Although there is some misguided discussion in the literature about whether error rates should be controlled when making multiple comparisons, the need for adjustments is a logical consequence of using Frequentist statistics such as the Neyman-Pearson approach (Thompson, 1998).</p>
<p>Consider an experiment where people are randomly assigned to either a control or experimental condition. Two unrelated dependent variables are measured to test a hypothesis. A researcher will conclude a specific manipulation has an effect, if there is a difference between the control group and the experimental group on either of these two dependent variables. Because two independent tests are performed, the probability of not making a Type 1 error when α = 0.05 is 0.95*0.95, or 0.9025. This means that the probability of concluding there is an effect, when there is no effect, is 1 - 0.9025 = 0.0975 instead of 0.05.</p>
<p>There are different ways to control for error rates, the easiest being the Bonferroni correction (divide the α by the number of tests), and an ever-so-slightly less conservative correction being the Holm-Bonferroni sequential procedure. For some multiple testing situations, dedicated statistical approaches have been developed. For example, sequential analyses (Lakens, 2014) control the error rate when researchers want to look at their data as it comes in, and stop the data collection whenever a statistically significant result is observed (this is also needed when updating meta-analyses). When the number of statistical tests becomes substantial, it is sometimes preferable to control false discovery rates, instead of error rates (Benjamini, Krieger, &amp; Yekutieli, 2006). Many procedures that control for false discovery rates take dependencies among hypotheses into account. All these approaches have the same goal of limiting the probability of saying there is an effect, when there is no effect.</p>
<p>The Bonferroni correction controls the familywise error rate, but what a family of tests is, requires some thought. The main reason this question is not straightforward is that error control does not just aim to control the number of erroneous statistical inferences, but the number of erroneous theoretical inferences. We therefore need to make a statement about which tests relate to a single theoretical inference, which depends on the theoretical question. I believe many of the problems researchers have in deciding how to correct for multiple comparisons is actually a problem in deciding what their theoretical question is.</p>
<p>Error rates can be controlled for all tests in an experiment (the experimentwise Type 1 error rate) or for a specific group of tests (the familywise Type 1 error rate). Broad questions have many possible answers. If we want to know if there is ‘an effect’ in a study, then rejecting the null-hypothesis in any test we perform would lead us to decide the answer to our question is ‘yes’. In this situation, the experimentwise Type 1 error rate correctly controls the probability of deciding there is any effect, when all null hypotheses are true. For example, in a 2x2x2 ANOVA, we test for three main effects, three two-way interactions, and one three-way interaction, which makes seven tests in total. If we use a 5% alpha level for every test, the probability that we will conclude there is an effect, when the null hypothesis is true, is 30%.</p>
<p>But researchers often have more specific questions. Let’s assume a researcher has designed an experiment that compares predictions from two competing theories. Theory A predicts an interaction in a 2x2 ANOVA, while Theory B predicts no interaction, but at least one significant main effect. The researcher will perform three tests, which we will assume is highly powered for any theoretically relevant effect size. One might intuitively assume that since we will perform three tests (two main effects and one interaction) we should control the error rate for all three tests, for example by using α/3. But when controlling the familywise error rate, what constitutes a ‘family’ depends on a set of theoretically related tests. In this case, where we test two theories, there are two families of tests, the first family consisting of a single interaction effect, and the second family of two main effects. With an overall alpha level of 5%, we will decide to accept Theory A when p &lt; α for the interaction, and we will decide no to accept Theory A when p &gt; α. If the null is true, at most 5% of these decisions we make in the long run will be incorrect, so the percentage of decision errors is controlled. Furthermore, we will decide to accept Theory B when p &lt; α/2 (using a Bonferroni correction) for either of the two main effects, and not accept theory B when p &gt; α/2. When the null hypothesis is true, we will decide to accept Theory B when it is not true at most 5% of the time. We could accept neither theory, or even both, if it turned out the experiment was not the crucial test the researcher had thought.</p>
<p>Some researchers criticize corrections for multiple comparisons because one might as well correct for all tests you do in your lifetime (Perneger, 1998). If you choose to use a Neyman-Pearson paradigm, as opposed to a Likelihood approach or Bayesian statistics, the only reason to correct for all tests you perform in your lifetime is when all the work you have done in your life tests a single theory, and you would use your last words to decide to accept or reject this theory, as long as only one of all individual tests you have performed yielded a p &lt; α. Researchers rarely work like this. Instead, they often draw a conclusion after a single study. It’s these intermediate decisions to accept or reject the null hypothesis that should not be wrong too often, in the long run. We control errors when we make decisions about theories, and we make these decisions more than once in our lifetime.</p>
<p>It might seem if researchers can find a way out of using error control by formulating a hypothesis for every possible test they will perform. Indeed, they can. For a ten by ten correlation matrix, a researcher might have theoretical predictions for all 45 individual correlations. If all these 45 predicted correlations are tests using an alpha level of 5%, the statistical inference is valid. However, readers might reasonably question the theoretical validity of these 45 tests. All statistical inferences interact with theoretical inferences at some point, and choices to control error rates are a good example of this.</p>
<p>Another criticism on corrections for multiple comparisons is that it is strange that the conclusions a researcher draws depend on the number of additional tests a researcher performs. For example, if a researcher had measured only a single dependent variable, a p = 0.04 would have led to a decision to reject the null hypothesis, but with a second dependent variable, the alpha level is reduced to 0.025, and now the same data no longer leads to the conclusion to reject the null hypothesis. Lowering alpha levels is a mathematical necessity when you want to control error rates, but it is not needed if all you want to do is quantify relative likelihoods of the data under different hypotheses.</p>
<p>Likelihood approaches look at the relative likelihood of the data, given two hypotheses (complemented with prior knowledge in Bayesian statistics). Likelihoods only care about the data. Obviously the probability that the strong evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis is a fluke increases with the number of tests that were performed. There are ways to control error rates in likelihood approaches and Bayesian statistics, but they are less straightforward than using a Neyman-Pearson approach. It might seem strange for someone who uses a likelihood approach (or Bayesian statistics) that conclusions depend on the number of additional tests that are performed. But from a Neyman-Pearson approach, it is similarly strange to interpret one out of 45 likelihood ratios or Bayes factors from a ten by ten correlation matrix as ‘strong evidence’ for a true effect, without taking into account 44 other tests were performed at the same time. Combining both approaches is probably a win-win, where long run error rates are controlled, after which the evidential value in individual studies in interpreted (and, because why not, parameters are estimated).</p>
<p>A better understanding of controlling error rates is useful. There are researchers who fear the current scientific climate is focusing too much on Type 1 error control, at the expense of Type 2 error control (Fiedler, Kutzner, &amp; Krueger, 2012). But this is not necessarily so. It all depends on how you design your experiments. Just like you need to lower the alpha level if multiple tests would allow you to reject the null hypothesis, you can choose to increase the alpha level if you will only reject the null hypothesis when multiple independent tests yield a p &lt; α. For example, it is perfectly fine to pre-register a set of two experiments, the second a close replication of the first, where you will choose to reject the null-hypothesis if the p-value is smaller than 0.2236 in both experiments. The probability that you will reject the null hypothesis twice in a row if the null hypothesis is true is α * α, or 0.2236 * 0.2236 = 0.05. In other words, if you set out to do a line of pre-registered studies, which you will report without publication bias, it makes sense to increase your alpha level. For example, an alpha level of 0.1 in both studies effectively limits the Type 1 error rate to 0.1 * 0.1 = 0.01. Conceptually, this is similar to deciding to base your decision on the outcome of a small-scale meta-analysis with an alpha of 0.01.</p>
<p>There is only one reason to calculate p-values, and that is to control Type 1 error rates using a Neyman-Pearson approach. Therefore, if you use p-values, you need to correct for multiple comparisons, but be smart about it. We need better error control, not necessarily stricter error control.</p>

<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Why banning p-values might not solve our problems.</h2>
<p>The journal Basic and Applied Social Psychology banned p-values a year ago. I read some of their articles published in the last year. I didn’t like many of them. Here’s why.</p>
<p>First of all, it seems BASP didn’t just ban p-values. They also banned confidence intervals, because God forbid you use that lower bound to check whether or not it includes 0. They also banned reporting sample sizes for between subject conditions, because God forbid you divide that SD by the square root of N and multiply it by 1.96 and subtract it from the mean and guesstimate whether that value is smaller than 0.</p>
<p>It reminds me of alcoholics who go into detox and have to hand in their perfume, before they are tempted to drink it. Thou shall not know whether a result is significant – it’s for your own good! Apparently, thou shall also not know whether effect sizes were estimated with any decent level of accuracy. Nor shall thou include the effect in future meta-analyses to commit the sin of cumulative science.</p>
<p>There are some nice papers where the p-value ban has no negative consequences. For example, Swab &amp; Greitemeyer (2015) examine whether indirect (virtual) intergroup contact (seeing you have 1 friend in common with an outgroup member, vs not) would influence intergroup attitudes. It did not, in 8 studies. P-values can’t be used to accept the null-hypothesis, and these authors explicitly note they aimed to control Type 2 errors based on an a-priori power analysis. So, after observing many null-results, they drew the correct conclusion that if there was an effect, it was very unlikely to be larger than what the theory on evaluative conditioning predicted. After this conclusion, they logically switch to parameter estimation, perform a meta-analysis and based on a Cohen’s d of 0.05, suggest that this effect is basically 0. It’s a nice article, and the p-value ban did not make it better or worse.</p>
<p>But in many other papers, especially those where sample sizes were small, and experimental designs were used to examine hypothesized differences between conditions, things don’t look good.</p>
<p>In many of the articles published in BASP, researchers make statements about differences between groups. Whether or not these provide support for their hypotheses becomes a moving target, without the need to report p-values. For example, some authors interpret a d of 0.36 as support for an effect, while in the same study, a Cohen’s d &lt; 0.29 (we are not told the exact value) is not interpreted as an effect. You can see how banning p-values solved the problem of dichotomous interpretations (I’m being ironic). Also, with 82 people divided over three conditions, the p-value associated with the d = 0.36 interpreted as an effect is around p = 0.2. If BASP had required authors to report p-values, they might have interpreted this effect a bit more cautiously. And in case you are wondering: No, this is not the only non-significant finding interpreted as an effect. Surprisingly enough, it seems to happen a lot more often than in journals where authors report p-values! Who would have predicted this?!</p>
<p>Saying one thing is bigger than something else, and reporting an effect size, works pretty well in simple effects. But how would say there is a statistically significant interaction, if you can’t report inferential statistics and p-values? Here are some of my favorite statements.</p>
<p>“The ANOVA also revealed an interaction between [X] and [Y], η² = 0.03 (small to medium effect).”</p>
<p>How much trust do you have in that interaction from an exploratory ANOVA with a small to medium effect size of .03, partial eta squared? That’s what I thought.</p>
<p>“The main effects were qualified by an [X] by [Y] interaction. See Figure 2 for means and standard errors”</p>
<p>The main effects were qualified, but the interaction was not quantified. What does this author expect I do with the means and standard errors? Look at it while humming ‘ohm’ and wait to become enlightened? Everybody knows these authors calculated p-values, and based their statements on these values.</p>
<p>In normal scientific journals, authors sometimes report a Bonferroni correction. But there’s no way you are going to Bonferroni those means and standard deviations, now is there? With their ban on p-values and confidence intervals, BASP has banned error control. For example, read the following statement:</p>
<p>Willpower theories were also related to participants’ BMI. The more people endorsed a limited theory, the higher their BMI. This finding corroborates the idea that a limited theory is related to lower self-control in terms of dieting and might therefore also correlate with patients BMI.</p>
<p>This is based on a two-sided p-value of 0.026, and it was one of 10 calculated correlation coefficient. Would a Bonferroni adjusted p-value have led to a slightly more cautious conclusion?</p>
<p>Oh, and if you hoped banning p-values would lead anyone to use Bayesian statistics: No. It leads to a surprisingly large number of citations to Trafimow’s articles where he tries to use p-values as measures of evidence, and is disappointed they don’t do what he expects. Which is like going to The Hangover part 4 and complaining it’s really not that funny. Except everyone who publishes in BASP mysteriously agrees that Trafimow’s articles show NHST has been discredited and is illogical.</p>
<p>In their latest editorial, Trafimow and Marks hit down some arguments you could, after a decent bottle of liquor, interpret as straw men against their ban of p-values. They don’t, and have never, discussed the only thing p-values are meant to do: control error rates. Instead, they seem happy to publish articles where some (again, there are some very decent articles in BASP) authors get all the leeway they need to adamantly claim effects are observed, even though these effects look a lot like noise.</p>
<p>The absence of p-values has not prevented dichotomous conclusions, nor claims that data support theories (which is only possible using Bayesian statistics), nor anything else p-values were blamed for in science. After reading a year’s worth of BASP articles, you’d almost start to suspect p-values are not the real problem. Instead, it looks like researchers find making statistical inferences pretty difficult, and forcing them to ignore p-values didn’t magically make things better.</p>
<p>As far as I can see, all that banning p-values has done, is increase the Type 1 error rate in BASP articles. Restoring a correct use of p-values would substantially improve how well conclusions authors draw actually follow from the data they have collected. The only expense, I predict, is a much lower number of citations to articles written by Trafimow about how useless p-values are.</p>

<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">4.3</span> Error Control in Exploratory ANOVA’s: The How and the Why</h2>
<p>In a 2X2X2 design, there are three main effects, three two-way interactions, and one three-way interaction to test. That’s 7 statistical tests.The probability of making at least one Type 1 error in a single ANOVA is 1-(0.95)^7=30%.</p>
<p>There are earlier blog posts on this, but my eyes were not opened until I read this paper by Angelique Cramer and colleagues (put it on your reading list, if you haven’t read it yet). Because I prefer to provide solutions to problems, I want to show how to control Type 1 error rates in ANOVA’s in R, and repeat why it’s necessary if you don’t want to fool yourself. Please be aware that if you continue reading, you will lose the bliss of ignorance if you hadn’t thought about this issue before now, and it will reduce the amount of p &lt;0.05 you’ll find in exploratory ANOVA’s.</p>
<p>Simulating Type 1 errors in 3-way ANOVA’s</p>
<p>Let’s simulate 250000 2x2x2 ANOVAs where all factors are manipulated between individuals, with 50 participants in each condition, and without any true effect (all group means are equal). The R code is at the bottom of this page. We store the p-values of the 7 tests. The total p-value distribution has the by now familiar uniform shape we see if the null hypothesis is true.</p>
<p>If we count the number of significant findings (even though there is no real effect), we see that from 250000 2x2x2 ANOVA’s, approximately 87.500 p-values were smaller than 0.05 (the left most bar in the Figure). This equals 250.000 ANOVA’s x 0.05 Type 1 errors x 7 tests. If we split up the p-values for each of the 7 tests, we see in the table below that as expected, each test has it’s own 5% error rate, which together add up to a 30% error rate due to multiple testing (i.e., the probability of not making a Type 1 error is 0.95<em>0.95</em>0.95<em>0.95</em>0.95<em>0.95</em>0.95, and the probability of making a Type 1 error is 1 minus this number). With a 2x2x2x2 ANOVA, the Type 1 errors you’ll make reach a massive 54%, making you about as accurate as a scientist as a coin-flipping toddler.</p>
<p>Let’s fix this. We need to adjust the error rate. The Bonferroni correction (divide your alpha level by the number of tests, so for 7 tests and alpha = 0.05 use 0.05/7-= 0.007 for each test) communicates the basic idea very well, but the Holm-Bonferroni correction is slightly better. In fields outside of psychology (e.g., economics, gene discovery) work on optimal Type 1 error control procedures continues. I’ve used the mutoss package in R in my simulations to check a wide range of corrections, and came to the conclusion that unless the number of tests is huge, we don’t need anything more fancy than the Holm-Bonferroni (or sequential Bonferroni) correction (please correct me if I’m wrong in the comments!). It orders p-values from lowest to highest, and tests them sequentially against an increasingly more lenient alpha level. If you prefer a spreadsheet, go here.</p>
<p>In a 2x2x2 ANOVA, we can test three main effects, three 2-way interactions, and one 3-way interaction. The table below shows the error rate for each of these 7 tests is 5% (for a total of 1-0.95^7=30%) but after the Holm-Bonferroni correction, the Type 1 error rate nicely controlled.</p>
<p>However, another challenge is to not let Type 1 error control increase the Type 2 errors too much. To examine this, I’ve simulated 2x2x2 ANOVA’s where there is a true effect. One of the eight cells has a small positive difference, and one has a small negative difference. As a consequence, with sufficient power, we should find 4 significant effects (a main effect, two 2-way interactions, and the 3-way interaction).</p>
<p>Let’s first look at the p-value distribution. I’ve added a horizontal and vertical line. The horizontal line indicates the null-distribution caused by the four null-effects. The vertical line indicates the significance level of 0.05. The two lines create four quarters. Top left are the true positives, bottom left are the false positives, top right are the false negatives (not significant due to a lack of power) and the bottom right are the true negatives.</p>
<p>Now let’s plot the adjusted p-values using Holm’s correction (instead of changing the alpha level for each test, we can also keep the alpha fixed, but adjust the p-value).</p>
<p>We see a substantial drop in the left-most column, and this drop is larger than the false height due to false positives. We also see a peculiarly high bar on the right, caused by the Holm correction adjusting a large number of p-values to 1. We can see this drop in power in the Table below as well. It’s substantial: From 87% power to 68% power.</p>
<p>If you perform a 2x2x2 ANOVA, we might expect you are not really interested in the main effects (if you were, a simply t-test would have sufficed). The power cost is already much lower if the exploratory analysis focusses on only four tests, the three 2-way interactions, and the 3-way interaction (see the third row in the Table below). Even exploratory 2x2x2 ANOVA’s are typically not 100% exploratory. If so, preregistering the subset of all tests you are interesting in, and controlling the error rate for this subset of tests, provides an important boost in power.</p>
<p>Oh come on you silly methodological fetishist!</p>
<p>If you think Type 1 error control should not endanger the discovery of true effects, here’s what you should not do. You should not wave your hands at controlling Type 1 error rates, saying it is ‘methodological fetishism’ (Ellemers, 2013). It ain’t gonna work. If you choose to report p-values (by all means, don’t), and want to do quantitative science (by all means, don’t) than the formal logic you are following (even if you don’t realize this) is the Neyman-Pearson approach. It allows you to say: ‘In the long run, I’m not saying there’s something, when there is nothing, more than X% of the time’. If you don’t control error rates, your epistemic foundation of making statements reduces to ‘In the long run, I’m not saying there’s something, when there is nothing, more than … uhm … nice weather for the time of the year, isn’t it?’.</p>
<p>Now just because you need to control error rates, doesn’t mean you need to use a Type 1 error rate of 5%. If you plan to replicate any effect you find in an exploratory study, and you set the alpha to 0.2, the probability of making a Type 1 error twice in a row is 0.2*0.2 = 0.04. If you want to explore four different interactions in a 2x2x2 ANOVA you intend to replicate in any case, setting you overall Type 1 error across two studies to 0.2, and then using an alpha of 0.05 for each of the 4 tests might be a good idea. If some effects would be costlier to miss, but others less costly, you can use an alpha of 0.8 for two effects, and an alpha of 0.02 for the other two. This is just one example. It’s your party. You can easily pre-register the choices you make to the OSF or AsPredicted to transparently communicate them.</p>
<p>You can also throw error control out of the window. There are approximately 1.950.000 hits in Google Scholar when I search for ‘An Exploratory Analysis Of’. Put these words in the title, list all your DV’s in the main test (e.g., in a table), add Bayesian statistics and effect sizes with their confidence intervals, and don’t draw strong conclusions (Bender &amp; Lange, 2001).</p>
<p>Obviously, the tricky thing is always what to do if your prediction was not confirmed. I think you enter a Lakatosian degenerative research line (as opposed to the progressive research line you’d be in if your predictions were confirmed). With some luck, there’s an easy fix. The same study, but using a larger sample, (or, if you designed a study using sequential analyses, simply continue the data collection after the first look at the data, Lakens, 2014) might get you back in a progressive research line after an update in the predicted effect size. Try again, with a better manipulation of dependent variable. Giving up on a research idea after a single failed confirmation is not how science works, in general. Statistical inferences tell you how to interpret the data without fooling yourself. Type 1 error control matters, and in most psychology experiments, is relatively easy to do. But it’s only one aspect of the things you take into account when you decide which research you want to do.</p>
<p>My main point here is that there are many possible solutions, and all you have to do is choose one that best fits your goals. Since your goal is very unlikely to be a 30% Type 1 error rate in a single study which you interpret as a 5% Type 1 error rate, you have to do something. There’s a lot of room between 100% exploratory and 100% confirmatory research, and there are many reasonable ideas about what the ‘family’ of errors is you want to control (for a good discussion on this, see Bender &amp; Lange, 2001). I fully support their conclusion (p. 344): “Whatever the decision is, it should clearly be stated why and how the chosen analyses are performed, and which error rate is controlled for”. Clear words, no hand waving.</p>
<p><strong>COMBINE WITH SUPERPOWER CHAPTER</strong></p>
<p>In a 2 x 2 x 2 design, an ANOVA will give the test results for three main effects, three two-way interactions, and one three-way interaction. That’s 7 statistical tests. The probability of making at least one type I error in a single 2 x 2 x 2 ANOVA is <span class="math inline">\(1-(0.95)^7 = 30\)</span>%.</p>

<p>When there is no true effect, we formally do not have ‘power’ (which is defined as the probability of finding p &lt; <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> if there is a true effect to be found) so the power column should be read as the ‘type I error rate’. Because we have saved the power simulation in the ‘simulation_result’ object, we can perform calculations on the ‘sim_data’ dataframe that is stored. This dataframe contains the results for the nsims simulations (e.g., 10000 rows if you ran 10000 simulations) and stores the p-values and effect size estimates for each ANOVA. The first 7 columns are the p-values for the ANOVA, first the main effects of condition 1, 2, and 3, then three two-way interactions, and finally the threeway interaction.</p>
<p>We can calculate the number of significant results for each test (which should be 5%) by counting the number of significant p-values in each of the 7 rows:</p>

<p>This is the type I error rate for each test. The familywise error rate refers to the probability of one or more of the tests in the ANOVA being significant, even though none of the 7 effects exist (3 main effects, 3 two-way interactions, and 1 three-way interaction).</p>
<p>To calculate this error rate we do not just add the 7 error rates (so 7 * 5% - 35%). Instead, we calculate the probability that there will be at least one significant result in an ANOVA we perform. Some ANOVA results will have multiple significant results, just due to the type I error rate (e.g., a significant result for the three-way interaction, and for the main effect of condition 1) but such an ANOVA is counted only once. If we calculate this percentage from our simulations, we see the number is indeed very close to <span class="math inline">\(1-(0.95)^7 = 30%\)</span>.</p>

<p>But what we should do about this alpha inflation? We do not want to perform exploratory ANOVAs and observe more type I errors than expected, because these significant effects will often not replicate if you try to build on them. Therefore, you need to control the type I error rate.</p>
<p>In the simulation code, which relies on the afex package, there is the option to set p_adjust. In the simulation above, <code>p_adjust</code> was set to <code>"none"</code>. This means no adjustment is made to alpha level for each test (above this was 0.05).</p>
<p>Afex relies on the <code>p.adjust</code> functon in the <code>stats</code> package in base R (more information is available <a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/stats/versions/3.1.1/topics/p.adjust">here</a>). From the package details:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The adjustment methods include the Bonferroni correction (“bonferroni”) in which the p-values are multiplied by the number of comparisons. Less conservative corrections are also included by Holm (1979) (“holm”), Hochberg (1988) (“hochberg”), Hommel (1988) (“hommel”), Benjamini &amp; Hochberg (1995) (“BH” or its alias “fdr”), and Benjamini &amp; Yekutieli (2001) (“BY”), respectively. A pass-through option (“none”) is also included. The first four methods are designed to give strong control of the family-wise error rate. There seems no reason to use the unmodified Bonferroni correction because it is dominated by Holm’s method, which is also valid under arbitrary assumptions.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Hochberg’s and Hommel’s methods are valid when the hypothesis tests are independent or when they are non-negatively associated (Sarkar, 1998; Sarkar and Chang, 1997). Hommel’s method is more powerful than Hochberg’s, but the difference is usually small and the Hochberg p-values are faster to compute.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The “BH” (aka “fdr”) and “BY” method of Benjamini, Hochberg, and Yekutieli control the false discovery rate, the expected proportion of false discoveries amongst the rejected hypotheses. The false discovery rate is a less stringent condition than the family-wise error rate, so these methods are more powerful than the others.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let’s re-run the simulation with the Holm-Bonferroni correction, which is simple and require no assumptions.</p>

<p>We see it is close to 5%.
Note that error rates have variation, and even in a ten thousand simulations, the error rate in the sample of studies can easily be half a percentage point higher or lower (see <a href="https://daniellakens.blogspot.com/2020/01/observed-alpha-levels-why-statistical.html">this blog</a>.
But <em>in the long run</em> the error rate should equal the alpha level. Furthermore, note that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holm%E2%80%93Bonferroni_method">Holm-Bonferroni</a> method is slightly more powerful than the Bonferroni procedure (which is simply <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> divided by the number of tests).
There are more powerful procedures to control the type I error rate, which require making more assumptions.
For a small number of tests, they Holm-Bonferroni procedure works well.
Alternative procedures to control error rates can be found in the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/multcomp/index.html">multcomp</a> R package.</p>
