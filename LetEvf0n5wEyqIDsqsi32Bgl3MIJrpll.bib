  abstract = {Until now tactile agnosia has been reported only in small, but detailed cross-sectional case studies. Here we show that multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) of early diffusion-weighted lesion maps can be used to accurately predict long-term recovery of tactile object recognition (TOR) in 35 subjects with varying hand skill impairment and associated specific daily activity limitation after cortical sensori-motor stroke. Multiple regression analysis revealed the essentially dysfunctional subprocesses for object recognition in the specifically impaired subjects, i.e., grasping as determined by a subtest of Jebsen Taylor hand function test, and perception of macrogeometrical object properties. The Gaussian process regression of MVPA represents a function that relates a selection of lesioned voxels as input variables to TOR performance scores as target variables. On the behavioural level, patients fell into three recovery subgroups, depending on TOR performance over the observation period. Only baseline motor hand skill and shape discrimination were significantly correlated with the TOR trajectories. To define functionally meaningful voxels, we combined information from MVPA of lesion maps and a priori knowledge of regions of interest derived from a data bank for shape recognition. A high significance for the predicted TOR performances over nine months could be verified by permutation tests, leading us to expect that the model generalises to larger patient cohorts with first cortical ischemic stroke. The lesion sites of the persistently impaired subjects exhibited an overlap with critical areas related to the MVPA prediction map in the cytoarchitectonic areas PFt of inferior parietal lobule and OP1 of parietal operculum which are associated with higher order sensory processing. This ultimate check corroborated the significance of the MVPA map for the prediction of tactile object recognition. The clinical implication of our study is that neuroimaging data acquired immediately after first stroke could facilitate individual forecasting of post-stroke recovery.},

  abstract = {When faced with risky decisions, people typically choose to diversify their choices by allocating resources across a variety of options and thus avoid putting ``all their eggs in one basket.'' The current research revealed that this tendency is reversed when people face an important cue to mating-related risk: skew in the operational sex ratio, or the ratio of men to women in the local environment. Counter to the typical strategy of choice diversification, findings from four studies demonstrated that the presence of romantically unfavorable sex ratios (those featuring more same-sex than opposite-sex individuals) led heterosexual people to diversify financial resources less and instead concentrate investment in high-risk/high-return options when making lottery, stock-pool, retirement-account, and research-funding decisions. These studies shed light on a key process by which people manage risks to mating success implied by unfavorable interpersonal environments. These choice patterns have important implications for mating behavior as well as other everyday forms of decision making.},

Recent literature indicates that people manage this threat with a suite of antipathogenic psychological and behavioral defense mechanisms, which motivate the avoidance of people and objects bearing cues to pathogen risk. Here, we demonstrate that self-image is also impacted by these mechanisms. In seven studies, pathogen cues led individuals chronically averse to germs to express greater concern about their own physical appearance. Correspondingly, these people exhibited behavioral intentions and decisions intended to conceal or improve their appearance, such as purchasing facial products, taking pharmaceuticals, and undergoing cosmetic surgery. This work opens a new area of investigation for infectious-disease psychology research and highlights the central role played by physical appearance in pathogen-related cognition.},

Consequently, Congress has turned to other means of influence, including the appropriations and oversight processes, although questions remain about the degree to which they have been effective. To investigate, I study a spatial model of administrative policymaking that assumes Congress can execute a legislative veto, as well as a baseline model in which congressional influence requires a coalition with the president. I compare the two models and develop empirical tests that exploit instances when their implications differ. Applying the tests to data on federal regulatory policymaking shows consistent evidence that Congress exerts veto power over administrative activity, even over those actions endorsed by the president. I conclude by discussing some broader implications, including the extent to which existing studies understate the constraints on presidential power.},

First, we examined all nonsignificant findings mentioned in the abstracts of the 2015 volumes of Psychonomic Bulletin \& Review, Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, and Psychological Science (N = 137). In 72\% of these cases, nonsignificant results were misinterpreted, in that the authors inferred that the effect was absent. Second, a Bayes factor reanalysis revealed that fewer than 5\% of the nonsignificant findings provided strong evidence (i.e., BF01 {$>$} 10) in favor of the null hypothesis over the alternative hypothesis. We recommend that researchers expand their statistical tool kit in order to correctly interpret nonsignificant results and to be able to evaluate the evidence for and against the null hypothesis.},

Because research has only considered how integral arousal (i.e., arousal from within the auction) affects bidding, the current research considered whether incidental arousal (i.e., arousal from outside the auction) also increases bidding. With two different manipulations of arousal, Experiments 1 and 2 showed that incidental arousal increased bidding in live auctions with monetary stakes. Experiment 1 also measured arousal physiologically to demonstrate its role in bidding. Experiment 3 utilized a third manipulation of incidental arousal and found that individuals were unaware of its effects. Overall, the current research demonstrates how bidders are potentially subject to many different sources of arousal that have nothing to do with auctions, all of which can unwittingly increase individuals' bidding.},

The main experiment used a hypothetical texting scenario to manipulate textism amounts (none/many) and participant's perceived power levels (low/ equal/high) during texting interactions to examine the number of textisms participants used in subsequent responses in comparison to the number of textisms they viewed. Primary results show that (1) participants moderately converged to use similar amounts of textisms, and (2) those with low power who viewed many textisms were more likely to use textisms themselves during subsequent responses. Through the examination of adaption behaviors in text messaging, scholars can better understand the contexts in which users will include textisms to intentionally convey nonverbal meaning and emotion in digital communication.},

We argue that people make motivated judgments of outgroup entitativity based on their pre-existing attitudes toward the outgroup and the valence of outgroup members' actions. In both a first study and a pre-registered replication, we find that when people have positive attitudes toward Muslims, they judge Muslims to be lower in entitativity following a Muslim's negative action and higher in entitativity following a Muslim individuals' positive action, thus holding Muslims responsible for positive, but not negative individual actions. We also find a weaker mirror pattern of effects for those who have negative attitudes toward Muslims.},

We provided evidence for the latter hypothesis using experiments that compared nonoverlapping groups of readers of two Indian languages (Telugu and Malayalam). Readers showed increased single-letter discrimination and decreased letter interactions for bigrams during visual search. Importantly, these interactions predicted subjects' overall reading fluency. In a separate brain-imaging experiment, we observed increased compositionality in readers, whereby responses to bigrams were more predictable from single letters. This effect was specific to the anterior lateral occipital region, where activations best matched behavior. Thus, learning to read facilitates visual processing by increasing the compositionality of visual word representations.},

These findings suggest that the earlier bilinguals are extensively exposed to L2, the less likely they are to perceive L1 sounds accurately.

However, the extent and circumstances under which these cortical networks overlap and/or interact remain unclear. Crucially, whereas previous studies employed experimental designs that tend to confound exogenous with endogenous attentional engagement, we used a cued target discrimination paradigm that behaviourally dissociates exogenous from endogenous attention processes. Participants engaged with endogenous attention cues, while simultaneous apparent motion cues were driving exogenous attention along the motion path towards or away from the target position. To interfere with dorsal or ventral attention networks, we delivered neuronavigated double-pulse TMS over either right intraparietal sulcus (rIPS) or right temporo-parietal junction (rTPJ) towards the end of the cue target interval, and compared the effects to a sham-TMS condition. For sham-TMS, endogenous and exogenous cueing both benefitted discrimination accuracy. Target discrimination was enhanced at validly versus invalidly cued locations (endogenous cueing benefit) as well as when targets appeared in versus out of the motion path (exogenous cueing benefit), despite motion being uninformative and task-irrelevant, replicating previous findings. Interestingly, both rIPS- and rTPJ-TMS abolished attention benefits from exogenous cueing, while endogenous cueing benefits were unaffected. Our findings provide evidence against independent involvement of the dorsal and ventral attention network nodes in exogenous attention processes.},

In contrast, groups collectively high in testosterone, which is associated with a heightened status drive, would be derailed by diversity. Analysis of 74 randomly assigned groups engaged in a group decision-making exercise provided support for these hypotheses. The findings suggest that diversity is beneficial for performance, but only if group-level testosterone is low; diversity has a negative effect on performance if group-level testosterone is high.

  abstract = {When designing a study, the planned sample size is often based on power analyses. One way to choose an effect size for power analyses is by relying on pilot data. A-priori power analyses are only accurate when the effect size estimate is accurate. In this paper we highlight two sources of bias when performing a-priori power analyses for between-subject designs based on pilot data. First, we examine how the choice of the effect size index ({$\eta$}2, {$\omega$}2 and {$\epsilon$}2) affects the sample size and power of the main study. Based on our observations, we recommend against the use of {$\eta$}2 in a-priori power analyses. Second, we examine how the maximum sample size researchers are willing to collect in a main study (e.g. due to time or financial constraints) leads to overestimated effect size estimates in the studies that are performed. Determining the required sample size exclusively based on the effect size estimates from pilot data, and following up on pilot studies only when the sample size estimate for the main study is considered feasible, creates what we term follow-up bias.

Though biracial people can vary their racial identity, the social consequences of context-dependent racial self-presentation remain underexplored. Five studies examined how contextual racial presentation among biracial people is perceived by high status groups. White participants read vignettes describing a biracial person contextually presenting in an academic situation and evaluated the target's character and behavior. Asian/White or Black/White biracial students who contextually presented as monoracial (compared to biracial presentation) were evaluated more negatively because they were perceived as less trustworthy (Studies 1\textendash 5). The effect of White contextual presentation was mediated by endorsement of stereotypes that biracial people are confused about their racial identity (Studies 4\textendash 5). Responses were robust to the status of the monoracial identity (Studies 1\textendash 2) and intention to benefit (Study 5), but varied by the availability of choice (e.g., conditions of forced choice; Study 3). The results suggest contextually choosing an identity carries social repercussions because it can activate explicit negative stereotypes about biracial individuals.},

We report two studies, designed to address the role of involuntary mental events in relation to hallucination proneness. Both studies showed that the self-reported frequency of involuntary memories and future projections was a robust predictor of hallucination proneness, even when controlling for measures of unwanted thoughts and rumination (Study 1) and measures of depression, dissociation, executive functions, imagery abilities, and personality (Study 2). In Study 1, the emotional intensity of involuntary memories and future projections also predicted hallucination proneness. The findings open a new avenue of research addressing the role of involuntary autobiographical memories and future projections in relation to hallucination and psychosis.},

One previous study linked mentalizing ability to individual differences in the personality trait Agreeableness. Agreeableness encompasses two major subdimensions: Compassion reflects tendencies toward empathy, prosocial behaviour, and interpersonal concern, whereas Politeness captures tendencies to suppress aggressive and exploitative impulses. We hypothesized that Compassion but not Politeness would be associated with better mentalizing ability. This hypothesis was confirmed in Study 1 (N~=~329) using a theory of mind task that required reasoning about the beliefs of fictional characters. Post hoc analyses indicated that the honesty facet of Agreeableness was negatively associated with mentalizing. In Study 2 (N~=~217), we examined whether individual differences in mentalizing and related traits were associated with patterns of resting?state functional connectivity in the brain. Performance on the theory of mind task was significantly associated with patterns of connectivity between the dorsal medial and core subsystems of the default network, consistent with evidence implicating these regions in mentalization.

  abstract = {Abstract The recombinant Lonomia obliqua Stuart-factor activator (rLosac) is a recombinant hemolin which belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily of cell adhesion molecules. It is capable of inducing pro-survival activity in serum-deprived human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and fibroblasts by increasing mitochondrial metabolism. We hypothesize that it could promote neuronal survival by acting on neuroenergetics. Our study reveals that treatment of primary mouse cortical neurons cultured in neurobasal medium lacking B27 supplement with rLosac led to an enhancement of cell viability in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. In parallel, preserved or enhanced phosphorylation of Akt, p44, and p42 MAPK, as well as mTOR was observed following treatment with rLosac. During deprivation, as assessed by western blot and qRT-PCR, protein and mRNA expression of MCT2 (the predominant neuronal monocarboxylate transporter allowing lactate use as an alternative energy substrate) decreased significantly in B27 supplement-deprived cortical neurons and was hardly detected after 24~h of deprivation. Interestingly, rLosac maintained MCT2 protein expression after 24~h of deprivation including at the cell surface without preventing mRNA loss. MCT2 knockdown reduced rLosac-enhanced cell viability, confirming its involvement in rLosac effect. Enhanced uptake of lactate was detected following rLosac treatment and might contribute to rLosac-enhanced viability during deprivation. In the presence of both lactate and rLosac, cell viability was higher than in the presence of lactate alone. Our observations suggest that rLosac promotes cell viability in stressed (B27 supplement-deprived) neurons by facilitating the use of lactate as energy substrate via the preservation of MCT2 protein expression.

We argue that such intergroup biases may result from an interaction of basic cognitive processes and the structure of the information ecology. This cognitiveecological model assumes that groups such as minorities and out-groups are often novel to a perceiver. At the level of cognition, novel groups are primarily associated with their unique attributes, that is, attributes that differentiate them from other groups. In the information ecology, however, unique attributes are likely to be negative. Thus, novel groups, and by proxy minorities and out-groups, tend to be associated with negative attributes, leading to an evaluative disadvantage. We demonstrated this disadvantage in three experiments in which participants successively formed impressions about two fictional groups associated with the same number of positive and negative attributes. Participants preferred the first group over the novel group as long as the groups' unique attributes were negative.},

Despite their crucial role, the study of the nature and organization of executive functions still faces inherent difficulties. Moreover, most executive function models put under test until now are brain-free models: they are defined and discussed without assumptions regarding the neural bases of executive functions. By using a latent variable approach, here we tested a brain-centered model of executive function organization proposing that two distinct domain-general executive functions, namely, criterion setting and monitoring, may be dissociable both functionally and anatomically, with a left versus right hemispheric preference of prefrontal cortex and related neural networks, respectively. To this end, we tested a sample of healthy participants on a battery of computerized tasks assessing criterion setting and monitoring processes and involving diverse task domains, including the verbal and visuospatial ones, which are well-known to be lateralized. By doing this, we were able to specifically assess the influence of these task domains on the organization of executive functions and to directly contrast a process-based model of EF organization versus both a purely domain-based model and a process-based, but domain-dependent one. The results of confirmatory factor analyses showed that a purely process-based model reliably provided a better fit to the observed data as compared to alternative models, supporting the specific theoretical model that fractionates a subset of executive functions into criterion setting and monitoring with hemispheric specializations emerging regardless of the task domain.},

Two studies investigated the compartmentalization of farm animals relative to other types of animals (e.g., pets, wild animals). In Study 1, a greater tendency to compartmentalize farm animals correlated negatively with the attribution of a higher status to these animals, with more differentiated perceptions between the standing of farm animals and pets, and with a lower inclusion of animals in the self. In Study 2, different justifying beliefs taping into human superiority, the endorsement of carnism, and feeling threatened by vegetarianism mediated the negative relation between compartmentalization of farm animals and the negative emotional outcomes felt when eating meat. Together, these findings confirm the relevance of applying the notion of compartmentalization to the specific realm of human\textendash animal relations.},

Some have argued that early life SES can fundamentally shift time preferences per se, such that those from low SES backgrounds favor current rewards over future rewards. Others have argued that, while early life SES has lasting effects on behavior, such effects are only observable in the presence of salient cues to mortality. Here, we propose an alternative framework that centers on environmental uncertainty. In this uncertainty management framework, early life deprivation promotes the development of strategies that minimize the downside costs of uncertainty across domains. We argue that this focus on managing uncertainty results in greater risk-aversion, present-orientation, and prosociality. Furthermore, these effects need not be dependent on salient cues to mortality. Across four large samples of participants (total N = 4714), we find that childhood deprivation uniquely predicts greater risk-aversion (both incentivized and hypothetical) and greater prosociality in economic games. Childhood deprivation also predicts greater present-orientation, but not above-and beyond current SES. We further find that mortality cues are not necessary to elicit these differences. Our results support an uncertainty management perspective on the effects of childhood SES on risk, time, and social preferences.},

We find significant and positive treatment effects on compliance after only one year that persist with reinforcement into a second post-treatment year. The public rating appears to decrease the costs of monitoring compliance for the central government without increasing public and media attention to pollution, highlighting when this mode of governance is likely to emerge.

Participants (46\% male; mean age~=~42~years, SD~=~11) completed the 200?item HEXACO Personality Inventory?Revised either as part of a job application (n~=~1613) or as part of low?stakes research (n~=~1613). A comprehensive set of invariance tests were performed. Applicants scored higher than non?applicants on honesty?humility (d~=~0.86), extraversion (d~=~0.73), agreeableness (d~=~1.06), and conscientiousness (d~=~0.77). The bifactor model provided improved model fit relative to a standard correlated factor model, and loadings on the evaluative factor of the bifactor model were highly correlated with other indicators of item social desirability. The bifactor model explained approximately two?thirds of the differences between applicants and non?applicants. Results suggest that rather than being a higher order construct, the general factor of personality may be caused by an item?level evaluative process. Results highlight the importance of modelling data at the item?level. Implications for conceptualizing social desirability, higher order structures in personality, test development, and job applicant faking are discussed.

  abstract = {Research on belief perseverance often suggests that people maintain or even strengthen their beliefs in response to disconfirming evidence. However, many studies demonstrating belief perseverance have presented participants with mixed evidence. The present research investigated whether people maintain their beliefs in response to a single pattern of findings. Across four studies, participants consistently shifted their beliefs in response to the evidence, even when it challenged their views on religion (Studies 1\textendash 3), politics (Study 3), gun control (Study 3), and capital punishment (Studies 3\textendash 4). Participants were also receptive to mixed evidence, shifting their beliefs in response to the first study presented and shifting back in response to the second (and overall, depolarizing in response to the evidence). Participants not only updated their beliefs about the research question but also sometimes their position on the issue. In some cases, bias emerged in participants' evaluations of evidence, but not in others. Evaluations of evidence quality generally predicted belief change in response to the evidence and did not largely explain the degree of belief maintenance participants exhibited. These findings suggest that people may be receptive to counter-attitudinal evidence when the findings are clear, and highlight the importance of further examining the conditions under which biased assimilation and belief perseverance (vs. change) occur.},

However, it is not known whether the perceptual systems of dyscalculics have implicit access to the sensory noise of numerosity judgements, and whether their perceptual systems take the noise levels into account in optimizing their perception. We tackled this question by measuring central tendency and serial dependence with a numberline task on dyscalculics and math-typical preadolescents. Numerosity thresholds were also measured with a separate 2AFC discrimination task. Our data confirmed that dyscalculics had poorer numerosity sensitivity and less accurate numberline mapping. Importantly, numberline responses, as well as central tendency and serial dependence strengths, were well predicted by sensory thresholds and could be modelled by a performance-optimizing Bayesian model based on sensory thresholds, suggesting that the functional architecture of systems encoding numerosity in dyscalculia is preserved. We speculate that the numerosity system of dyscalculics has retained those perceptual strategies that are useful to cope with and compensate for low sensory resolution.},

  abstract = {Numerous studies have demonstrated that native Mandarin speakers have pervasive difficulties processing L2 English agreement morphology. However, less is known about the lexical and morphological cues that may modulate Mandarin speakers' sensitivity to English number agreement. To investigate this, we examined subject-verb agreement processing in English by L1 Mandarin participants using event-related brain potentials (ERPs) and focused on the use of quantificational cues to noun number and their interaction with agreement morphology on the verb. Previous work in English monolinguals has shown that agreement violations elicited larger P600s when preceded by a plurally quantified subject noun phrase (NP) compared to an unquantified NP. In the present study, Mandarin speakers were tested on the same quantified and unquantified sentences (e.g., Most/The cookies taste/*tastes\ldots ) as in the prior work. Like the L1 English speakers, ERPs time-locked to the verb showed a reliable P600 in response to agreement violations. However, the P600 in Mandarin speakers was larger for ungrammatical verbs with unquantified subjects, a contrast with English monolinguals. First, these results demonstrate that L2 agreement violations can elicit qualitatively similar neural responses in L1 Mandarin speakers as in English monolinguals (P600 effects), a finding that is to our knowledge novel. Second, quantification modulated the P600 in the L2 speakers in a qualitatively different way than in natives. Overall, these findings suggest stronger reliance on lexical versus morphological cues to number in Mandarin speakers, and that this impacts anticipation of subsequent grammatical features.},

The present research examined whether women behave more aggressively toward a sexualized woman and whether this is explained by lower ratings of the target's humanness. Results showed that women rated another woman lower on uniquely human personality traits when she was dressed in a sexualized (vs. conventional) manner. Lower humanness ratings subsequently predicted increased aggression toward her in a behavioral measure of aggression. This effect was moderated by trait intrasexual competitiveness; lower humanness ratings translated into more aggression, but only for women scoring relatively high on intrasexual competition. Follow-up studies revealed that the effect of sexualized appearance on perceived humanness was not due to the atypicality of the clothing in a university setting. The current project reveals a novel psychological mechanism through which interacting with a sexualized woman promotes aggressive behavior toward her.},

Psychological scientists often prefer to invest the time and effort that would be necessary to document existing data well in other duties, such as writing and collecting more data. Codebooks therefore tend to be unstandardized and stored in proprietary formats, and they are rarely properly indexed in search engines. This means that rich data sets are sometimes used only once\textemdash by their creators\textemdash and left to disappear into oblivion. Even if they can find an existing data set, researchers are unlikely to publish analyses based on it if they cannot be confident that they understand it well enough. My codebook package makes it easier to generate rich metadata in human- and machine-readable codebooks. It uses metadata from existing sources and automates some tedious tasks, such as documenting psychological scales and reliabilities, summarizing descriptive statistics, and identifying patterns of missingness. The codebook R package and Web app make it possible to generate a rich codebook in a few minutes and just three clicks. Over time, its use could lead to psychological data becoming findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable, thereby reducing research waste and benefiting both its users and the scientific community as a whole.},

Research has examined its prevalence, forms, and functions, but little is known about its severity and the personality and cognitive correlates. This study examined personality traits and early maladaptive schemas in a Canadian nonclinical sample (N = 156, age M = 25.23 years, SD = 8.14 years) consisting of 3 equal-sized groups (n = 52; 43 women, 9 men), matched on sex and age, and that varied on NSSI severity: high NSSI, low NSSI, and control. Participants completed the Deliberate Self-Harm Inventory, Big Five Inventory, and Early Maladaptive Schema Questionnaire \textendash{} Short Form. Results showed that high and low NSSI groups scored significantly higher than the control on neuroticism, and significantly lower on extraversion, agreeableness, and conscientiousness (Cohen's d ranges between .50 and 1.53; p ranges from {$<$} .01 to {$<$} .001). High NSSI group was significantly less agreeable than Low NSSI group (Cohen's d = .37; p = .04). Both high and low NSSI groups scored significantly higher on all early maladaptive schemas (Cohen's d ranges between .63 and 1.71; p ranges from {$<$} .01 to {$<$} .001), except for self-sacrifice beliefs. High NSSI group was significantly higher than Low NSSI (Cohen's d = .60; p = .005) and control (Cohen's d = .69; p {$<$} .001) groups on beliefs related to unrelenting standards. Given the link between perfectionism and suicide, the findings support the importance of focusing on specific maladaptive beliefs in NSSI with implications for interventions.},

We asked if concerns for group reputation might determine how people respond to the moral indiscretions of group members. In four studies, participants read about an immoral act committed by a member of their political party. The act was either publicly known to people outside of the participant's political party (i.e., ``public transgression'') or hidden from public view (i.e., ``private transgression''). In the public transgression condition, participants endorsed having their political party openly denounce the transgressor in an apparent effort to prevent the party's reputation from being tarnished by association. In the private transgression condition, however, they were reluctant to publicly report the transgressive party member, presumably to prevent reputational loss. Feelings of responsibility for the group arising from either identity fusion with the party or being experimentally assigned to occupy a position of responsibility for the party amplified these effects. Strongly fused participants were even willing to contemplate extreme, unethical actions aimed at protecting party reputation (e.g. tampering with incriminating evidence), regardless of the publicness of the transgression. We conclude that feelings of responsibility for the group and reputational considerations determine whether people denounce or protect ingroup transgressors.},

Overall, we found a reliable sensitivity to L2 morphosyntax at advanced proficiencies (d = .20, 95\% CIs .15, .25), with some evidence that this was reliably lower than for native speakers (NSs). These patterns were not generally moderated by linguistic feature or sentence region. However, effects for anomaly detection were larger among NSs than L2 learners and the effects among L2 learners appeared to show a trend toward L1 influence. Finding smaller effects than in other subdomains, we provide an initial framework of reference for L2 reading time effect sizes.},

Similarly, participants                     implicitly evaluated their own religion most positively and the remaining                     religions in accordance with the following hierarchy: Christianity {$>$} Judaism                     {$>$} Hinduism or Buddhism {$>$} Islam. In a final study, participants of all ages                     implicitly evaluated age groups following this rule: children {$>$} young adults                     {$>$} middle-age adults {$>$} older adults. These results suggest that the rules                     of social evaluation are pervasively embedded in culture and mind.},

However, as predicted by system justification or cultural learning perspectives, outgroup favoritism among non-dominant groups is occasionally observed, particularly implicitly. The present research found that non-dominant group members displayed simultaneous ingroup and dominant group implicit favoritism. On indirect measures focusing on positive valence, members of non-dominant racial (Studies 1 and 4), religious (Study 2), and sexual (Study 3) groups showed ingroup favoritism. On indirect measures focusing on negative valence, members of non-dominant groups showed diminished ingroup favoritism, and sometimes favoritism towards the culturally dominant group. These results may indicate that positive self-regard forms associations between the ingroup and positive, whereas cultural learning and system justification form associations between non-dominant groups and negative. A cross-cultural design (Study 5) also found results compatible with these assumptions.},

Does this reflect the indirect effects of a passively maintained representation of the previous experience, or is this representation reactivated when a new event occurs? To answer this question, we attempted to decode the orientation of the stimulus on the previous trial from the electroencephalogram on the current trial in a working memory task. Behavioral data confirmed that the previous-trial stimulus orientation influenced the reported orientation on the current trial, even though the previous-trial orientation was now task irrelevant. In two independent experiments, we found that the previous-trial orientation could be decoded from the current-trial electroencephalogram, indicating that the current-trial stimulus reactivated or boosted the representation of the previous-trial orientation. These results suggest that the effects of recent experiences on behavior are driven, in part, by a reactivation of those experiences and not solely by the indirect effects of passive memory traces.},

Participants underwent functional MRI while they considered personally reading and sharing New York Times articles. Activity in neural regions involved in positive valuation, self-related processing, and taking the perspective of others was significantly associated with decisions to select and share articles, and scaled with preferences to do so. Activity in all three sets of regions was greater when participants considered sharing articles with other people rather than selecting articles to read themselves. The findings suggest that people may consider value not only to themselves but also to others even when selecting news articles to consume personally. Further, sharing heightens activity in these pathways, in line with our proposal that humans derive value from self-reflection and connecting to others via sharing.},

Although we found some support for this hypothesis, an improved analysis and further studies indicated that the effect was strongly dependent on the stimuli used. We then used stimulus sampling and showed that the original association between fluency and perceived safety was not replicable with the newly constructed stimuli. We found the association between fluency and perceived safety using the newly constructed stimuli in a final study, but only when pronounceability was confounded with word length. The results cast doubt on generalizability of the association between pronounceability and perceived safety and underscore the importance of treating stimulus as a random factor.},

Emerging evidence suggests that the physical coordination involved in synchronizing one's behavior with another engages the cognitive systems involved in reasoning about others' mental states (i.e., mentalizing). In three experiments (N=959), we demonstrate that physically moving in synchrony with others fosters some features of mentalizing \textendash{} a core feature of human social cognition. In small groups, participants moved synchronously or asynchronously with others in a musical performance task. In Experiment 1, we found that synchrony, as compared to asynchrony, increased self-reported tendencies and abilities for considering others' mental states. In Experiment 2, we replicated this finding, but found that this effect did not extend to accuracy in mental state recognition. In Experiment 3, we tested synchrony's effects on diverse mentalizing measures and compared performance to both asynchrony and a no-movement control condition. Results indicated that synchrony decreased mental state attribution to socially non-relevant targets, and increased mental state attribution to specifically those with whom participants had synchronized. These results provide novel evidence for how synchrony, a common feature of cultural practices and day-to-day interpersonal coordination, shapes our sociality by engaging mentalizing capacities.},

Profundity ratings for PPBS have been found to be negatively related to analytical thinking and positively related to epistemically suspect beliefs (e.g. belief in the paranormal). Conceptually similar traits within the Openness/Intellect (O/I) domain form a simplex, whereby traits are arranged along a single dimension from intelligence to apophenia (i.e. observing patterns or causal connections were none exist). Across two studies (total N~=~297), we attempted to replicate the O/I simplex and determine how it relates to perceiving PPBS as profound. Participants completed questionnaires measuring traits from the O/I simplex and provided profundity ratings for PPBS. Profundity ratings of PPBS tended to correlate negatively with intelligence and positively with apophenia. The association with intelligence generally reflected a greater ability to discriminate the profound from the pseudo-profound, whereas the association with apophenia reflected poorer discrimination in Study 1, with less conclusive results in Study 2. In both studies, the O/I simplex was closely replicated. The results suggest a link between the O/I domain and perceiving PPBS as profound and tentatively support the theory that intelligence may protect against apophenia. ? 2018 European Association of Personality Psychology},

This experiment allowed us to analyze whether participants read through the consent form, and if they paid more attention to a specific part of the form than others.

At the conclusion of the study, participants were given a prompt to recall the code word. The results of this preregistered study show that, of the 136 participants, only 20 participants correctly recalled the code word.

  abstract = {To accomplish even rudimentary tasks, our cognitive system must update its representation of the changing environment. This process relies on visual working memory (VWM), which can actively modify its representations. We argue that this ability depends on a pointer system, such that each representation is stably and uniquely mapped to a specific stimulus. Without these pointers, VWM representations are inaccessible and therefore unusable. In three Electroencephalogram (EEG) experiments, we examined whether the pointers are allocated in an object-based, featural, or spatial manner: three factors that were confounded in previous studies. We used a feature change-detection task, in which objects moved and could separate into independently-moving parts. Despite the movement and separation being completely task-irrelevant, we found that the separation invalidated the pointers. This happened in a shape task, where the separation changed both the objects and the task-relevant features, but importantly, also in a color task, where the separation destroyed the objects while leaving the task-relevant features intact. Furthermore, even in a color task where all items had identical shapes, object-separation invalidated the pointers. This suggests that objects and not task-relevant features underlie the pointer system. Finally, when each object-part could be individuated already before the separation, the pointers were maintained, suggesting that the pointers are specifically tied to objects rather than locations. These results shed new light on the pointers which underlie VWM performance, demonstrating that the pointer system is object-based regardless of the task requirements.},

The threat of punishment lowered the average quality and quantity of information processed, compared with the prospect of reward or no performance incentive at all. The threat of punishment also induced less cautious decision making by lowering people's decision thresholds relative to the prospect of reward. These findings suggest that information-processing dynamics are determined not only by objective properties of the decision environment but also by the higher order goals of the system.},

Second, we showed that increased hunger, which is associated with lower self-control, reduced the magnitude effect. Third, we tested an intervention designed to increase self-control and showed that it reduced the magnitude effect.

With New York departing near the middle of the Convention, equal apportionment and the Three-Fifths Clause both became stable, and the Great Compromise was reached.

We ran an experiment varying the politician (by party and race) calling an implicit racial appeal by Donald Trump racist. We find that charging Trump's campaign appeal as racist does not persuade racially conservative whites to decrease support for Trump. Rather, it causes racially liberal whites to evaluate Trump more unfavorably. Our results hold up when attentiveness, old-fashioned racism, and partisanship are taken into account.

  abstract = {Of all the things a person could say in a given situation, what determines what is worth saying? Greenfield's principle of informativeness states that right from the onset of language, humans selectively comment on whatever they find unexpected. In this article, we quantify this tendency using information-theoretic measures and report on a study in which we tested the counterintuitive prediction that children will produce words that have a low frequency given the context, because these will be most informative. Using corpora of child-directed speech, we identified adjectives that varied in how informative (i.e., unexpected) they were given the noun they modified. In an initial experiment (N = 31) and in a replication (N = 13), 3-year-olds heard an experimenter use these adjectives to describe pictures. The children's task was then to describe the pictures to another person. As the information content of the experimenter's adjective increased, so did children's tendency to comment on the feature that adjective had encoded. Furthermore, our analyses suggest that children balance informativeness with a competing drive to ease production.},

Further, merely taking mental photos had similar effects on memory. These results provide support for the idea that photo taking induces a shift in attention toward visual aspects and away from auditory aspects of an experience. Additional findings were in line with this mechanism: Participants with a camera had better recognition of aspects of the scene that they photographed than of aspects they did not photograph. Furthermore, participants who used a camera during their experience recognized even nonphotographed aspects better than participants without a camera did. Meta-analyses including all reported studies support these findings.},

Further, the negative effects of incentives hold only when the incentives imply a selfish motive; advocates who are offered a matching incentive (i.e., who are told that the donations they successfully solicit will be matched), which is not incompatible with altruism, perform just as well as those who are not incentivized. Thus, incentives may affect prosocial outcomes in ways not previously investigated: by crowding out individuals' sincerity of expression and thus their ability to gain support for a cause.},

These effects were also buffered by task enjoyment so that individuals who enjoyed the dynamic decision-making task did not experience ego-depletion effects. These findings confirm that past ego-depletion effects on decision-making are not limited to static or isolated decision-making tasks and can be extended to dynamic, naturalistic decision-making processes more common to naturalistic settings.

We observed that information was exchanged primarily among individuals with similar ideological preferences in the case of political issues (e.g., 2012 presidential election, 2013 government shutdown) but not many other current events (e.g., 2013 Boston Marathon bombing, 2014 Super Bowl). Discussion of the Newtown shootings in 2012 reflected a dynamic process, beginning as a national conversation before transforming into a polarized exchange. With respect to both political and nonpolitical issues, liberals were more likely than conservatives to engage in cross-ideological dissemination; this is an important asymmetry with respect to the structure of communication that is consistent with psychological theory and research bearing on ideological differences in epistemic, existential, and relational motivation. Overall, we conclude that previous work may have overestimated the degree of ideological segregation in social-media usage.},

Twenty-three neurotypical adults and 19 individuals with aphasia served as participants. Aphasic individuals were randomly assigned to receive a 12-week course of linguistically-based treatment of passive sentence production and comprehension (N~=~14, treatment group) or to serve as control participants (N~=~5, natural history group). Both aphasic groups performed two offline tasks at baseline and three months following (at post-testing) to assess production and comprehension of trained passive structures and untrained syntactically related and unrelated structures. The aphasic participants and a healthy age-matched group also performed an online eyetracking comprehension task and a picture-verification fMRI task, which were repeated at post-testing for the aphasic groups. Results showed that individuals in the treatment, but not in the natural history, group improved on production and comprehension of both trained structures and untrained syntactically related structures. Treatment also resulted in a shift toward more normal-like eye movements and a significant increase in neural activation from baseline to post-testing. Upregulation encompassed right hemisphere regions homologs of left hemisphere regions involved in both sentence processing and domain-general functions and was positively correlated with treatment gains, as measured by offline comprehension accuracy, and with changes in processing strategies during sentence comprehension, as measured by eyetracking. These findings provide compelling evidence in favor of the contribution of both networks within the right hemisphere to the restoration of normal-like sentence processing patterns in chronic aphasia.},

An important finding for theory and intervention is that children's inhibitory control improves if an adult imposes a delay before they can act. Such findings have suggested that the passage of time allows impulsive urges to dissipate passively. However, in prior studies with imposed delays, children were also reminded about what they should be doing, which may have aided their activation of goal-relevant information. We tested this possibility by independently manipulating delays and task reminders, and measuring 3-year-olds' abilities to inhibit opening boxes in a go/no-go box-search task. Task reminders, but not adult-imposed delays, improved children's response inhibition. However, as in prior work, children who spontaneously delayed their action longer on go trials exhibited better response inhibition on no-go trials. These results pose a challenge to the view that the passage of time plays a causal role, suggest that spontaneous delays index other processes that improve inhibitory control, and highlight the importance of goal activation in developing inhibitory control.},

A wide range of evidence from Britain between 2010 and 2015 supports this claim. In the British Election Study, deficit attitudes vary systematically with the source of news consumption, even controlling for party identification. A structural topic model of two major newspapers' reporting shows that content varies systematically with respect to coverage of public borrowing\textemdash in ways that intuitively accord with the attitudes of their readership. Finally, a survey experiment suggests causation from media to attitudes: deficit preferences change based on the presentation of deficit information.},

Across three studies, participants exposed to the Stanford orientation relative to a control orientation, reported greater expectations for hostile and oppressive behavior on the part of the study's investigator and from others and themselves as guards.

To compare these accounts, 20 English?German bilingual adults were taught an artificial language containing 48 novel written words that varied orthogonally in English and German wordlikeness (neighborhood size and orthotactic probability). Wordlikeness in each language improved word production accuracy, and similarity to one language provided the same benefit as dual?language overlap.

  abstract = {Heterotopagnosia-without-Autotopagnosia (HwA) is characterized by the incapacity to point to body parts on others, but not on one's own body. This has been classically interpreted as related to a self-other distinction, with impaired visual representations of other bodies seen in third person perspective (3PP), besides spared own body somatosensory representations in 1PP. However, HwA could be impacted by a deficit in the integration of visual and somatosensory information in space, that are spatially congruent in the case of one's own body, but not for others' body. Here, we test this hypothesis in a rare neurological patient with HwA, H+, as well as in a control patient with a comparable neuropsychological profile, but without HwA, and in age-matched healthy controls, in two experiments. First, we assessed body part recognition in a new task where somatosensory information from the participant's body and visual information from the target body shown in virtual reality was never aligned in space. Results show that, differently from the flawless performance in controls, H+ committed errors for not only the body of others in 3PP, but for all conditions where the information related to the real and the target body was not spatially congruent. Then, we tested whether the integration between these multisensory bodily cues in space, as during visuo-tactile stimulation in the full-body illusion, improves the patient's performance. Data show that after the stimulation prompting visuo-tactile integration, but not in control conditions, the patient's abilities to process body parts improved up to normal level, thus confirming and extending the first findings. Altogether, these results support a new interpretation of HwA as linked to the matching between somatosensory inputs from one's body and visual information from a body seen at a distance, and encourage the application of multisensory stimulation and virtual reality for the treatment of body-related disorders.},

We examined the possibility that painful experiences can promote cooperation within social groups. In Experiments 1 and 2, we induced pain by asking some participants to insert their hands in ice water and to perform leg squats. In Experiment 3, we induced pain by asking some participants to eat a hot chili pepper. Participants performed these tasks in small groups. We found evidence for a causal link: Sharing painful experiences with other people, compared with a no-pain control treatment, promoted trusting interpersonal relationships by increasing perceived bonding among strangers (Experiment 1) and increased cooperation in an economic game (Experiments 2 and 3). Our findings shed light on the social effects of pain, demonstrating that shared pain may be an important trigger for group formation.},

Average monthly, seasonal, and annual temporal resolutions are provided for 30-m spatial resolution surfaces. Local heterogeneity was considered, integrating meteorological station data, high-quality terrain information (altitude, latitude, distance to the sea, and solar potential radiation) and multivariate regression modelling in a Geographical Information System. Climate surfaces of air temperature (minimum, maximum, and mean) and precipitation were obtained and used to derive maps of bioclimatic interest such as potential evapotranspiration, water availability, and growing degree-days. Metadata are provided in XML standard format (ISO 19139) with all the usual fields and quality indicators for each map, with an RMSE ranging from 0.7 to 1.2\textdegree C and 11 to 15~mm for air temperature and precipitation maps respectively.

This process is partially supported by statistical learning, the ability to extract patterns from the environment. Given that speech segmentation represents a potential bottleneck for language acquisition, patterns in speech may be extracted very rapidly, without extensive exposure. This hypothesis was examined by exposing participants to continuous speech streams composed of novel repeating nonsense words. Learning was measured on-line using a reaction time task. After merely one exposure to an embedded novel word, learners demonstrated significant learning effects, as revealed by faster responses to predictable than to unpredictable syllables. These results demonstrate that learners gained sensitivity to the statistical structure of unfamiliar speech on a very rapid timescale. This ability may play an essential role in early stages of language acquisition, allowing learners to rapidly identify word candidates and ``break in'' to an unfamiliar language.},

Analyses compared voting intentions before and after the initial Ebola outbreak and assessed correlations between Internet search activity for the term ``Ebola'' and voting intentions. Results revealed that (a) the psychological salience of Ebola was associated with increased intention to vote for Republican candidates and (b) this effect occurred primarily in states characterized by norms favoring Republican Party candidates (the effect did not occur in states with norms favoring Democratic Party candidates). Ancillary analyses addressed several interpretational issues. Overall, these results suggest that disease outbreaks may influence voter behavior in two psychologically distinct ways: increased inclination to vote for politically conservative candidates and increased inclination to conform to popular opinion.},

Although existing theories predict that multinational enterprises (MNEs) avoid locations where institutions cannot constrain public and private actors' opportunistic behavior, we argue host institutions' attractiveness depends on firms' home environment. Home country institutions shape firms' practices and capabilities, thus helping to determine the environments that firms are best prepared to face abroad. We test our predictions using multiple data sets at different levels of analysis: firm-level data on MNEs' foreign subsidiaries, data on bilateral foreign direct investment (FDI) positions, and longitudinal data on bilateral FDI flows. We find that states with independent judiciaries are particularly attractive to investment from countries also possessing independent courts. Similarly, countries with low judicial independence disproportionately send FDI to countries lacking independent judiciaries. These findings' implications challenge conventional wisdom: ``Good'' institutions may not attract all investors, and ``bad'' institutions may not always deter, as current research suggests.},

Four main experiments and six supplemental studies (total N = 3684) demonstrate that people prefer to direct persuasion efforts toward individuals who seem poised to shift their attitudes qualitatively (e.g., from negative to positive) rather than non-qualitatively (e.g., from positive to more positive). This preference stems from the fact that qualitative attitude change is perceived as greater in magnitude and expected to have a larger impact on behavior. These findings provide initial insight into the factors that drive persuasion target selection, and are inconsistent with what past persuasion research, conventional marketing wisdom, and our empirical evidence suggests persuaders should do. People tend to select persuasion targets they believe they can change qualitatively, but at least sometimes can have greater persuasive impact by targeting individuals who are already leaning in their direction.},

  abstract = {Abstract The MaRIUS-G2G datasets were produced for the MaRIUS (Managing the Risks, Impacts and Uncertainties of drought and water Scarcity) project, using the Grid-to-Grid (G2G) national-scale hydrological model for Great Britain. There are six separate datasets, with each of three combinations of meteorological driving data (two observation-based and one from climate model ensembles) used to produce two types of outputs (daily time-series of natural river flow for 260 sites, and monthly 1~?~1~km grids of natural flow and soil moisture in the unsaturated zone). The driving data required by G2G are rainfall and potential evaporation (PE). Two of the datasets from observation-based driving data use rainfall from CEH-GEAR (CEH-Gridded Estimates of Areal Rainfall) with PE from MORECS (Met Office Rainfall and Evaporation Calculation System), and cover the period 1960?2015, while the other two use CEH-GEAR rainfall with PE derived from 5~km temperature data using the Oudin method, and cover 1891?2015. The two datasets based on driving data (rainfall and PE) from the climate model ensembles cover three periods: Historical Baseline (1900?2006), Near-Future (2020?2049), and Far-Future (2070?2099). Data for a 30-year Baseline period (1975?2004), against which the Near-Future and Far-Future periods should be compared, are also available directly. There are 100 members in each ensemble, and the future periods use the RCP8.5 emissions scenario. This paper provides details of the G2G model and the different sets of meteorological driving data, as well as the availability and formatting of the output datasets. It also describes some recent and potential applications of the datasets, which have already been used to support historical and future analyses of low flow and drought characteristics across Britain, and provides some guidance on how the climate model-driven datasets should (and should not) be used.

We investigated the structure of a network of CG and PTG elements to elucidate how grief and growth can co-occur within a potentially causal system in bereaved young adults. Challenges to control and identity disturbance ranked as the most highly central symptoms in the CG network; the discovery of a new life path and greater personal strength were similarly central elements of PTG. Finally, the degree of disruption and change in mourners' worldviews emerged as the element that most strongly bridged the two domains, suggesting a pivotal connection between grief and growth.},

Dynamic learning rates were estimated to assess the relative importance ascribed to new information in response to volatility. Mixed-effects regression was used to analyze throw patterns as a function of social anxiety symptoms. Higher social anxiety predicted fewer throws to the previously punishing avatar and different learning rates after certain role changes, suggesting that social anxiety may be characterized by difficulty updating learned social probabilities. Socially anxious individuals may miss the chance to learn that a once-punishing situation no longer poses a threat.},

  abstract = {Much is known about stress and its resulting strain (i.e., negative outcomes such as burnout or impaired health), but not about how we perceive others' strain and what the outcomes of such strain perceptions are. We integrated the social-projection and stress-mindset literatures to investigate, for the first time, the effect of holding a stress-is-enhancing, versus a stress-is-debilitating, mindset on social judgments of a target's strain, on the perceiver's consequent perceptions of the target's promotability, and on his or her intention to voluntarily help the target. We argued that perceivers may project their own stress-mindsets onto others, resulting in egocentrically-biased judgments of the latter's strain. We conducted four experimental and correlational studies, among 971 fully-employed Americans and Israelis, using a novel stress-mindset manipulation. We predicted and found evidence that, independent of the effects of mood, individuals holding a stress-is-enhancing versus a stress-is-debilitating mindset were less likely to judge a target experiencing a heavy workload as suffering from burnout, somatic symptoms, or presenteeism (i.e., reduced productivity at work due to health problems). We also revealed two important downstream outcomes: whereas the lower strain judgments associated with a stress-is-enhancing mindset led to a higher estimate of the target's promotability, they also led to a lower likelihood of helping him. Taken together, our findings establish a causal link between stress-mindset and judgments of others' strain, thereby extending the novel notion of stress-mindset beyond intra-personal outcomes to inter-personal effects. Results provide a foundation for future work addressing the accuracy of judgment of others' stress experience.},

Across three studies (Study 1a, N = 185; Study 1b, N = 359; Study 2, N = 429), we used an experimental vignette methodology in which people were randomly assigned to read descriptions that either emphasized an affiliation (i.e., intimacy group) or achievement (i.e., task group) context, and then subsequently emphasized a group's warmth, competence, or generally positive characteristics (i.e., control condition). For evaluations of both intimacy and task groups relative to a control condition, groups were perceived to lack warmth when described as highly competent, and groups were perceived to lack competence when described as highly warm. Though the direct effect of using innuendo on desire to join produced mixed results across studies, the mediation analyses in Studies 1b and 2 show that providing positive information about a group's warmth or competence, but omitting the contextually salient dimension of social perception (i.e., omission of warmth for intimacy groups and competence for task groups), indirectly weakened people's desire to join the group. Overall, this suggests that the innuendo effect generalizes to judgments of voluntary small groups, highlighting that failing to provide information about one of the dimensions of social perception (i.e., warmth or competence) can promote less favorable evaluations on that omitted dimension \textendash{} even when descriptions contain wholly positive information.},

In contrast, we argue that new information can also arise about the likely future government's resolve in following through with its policy goals, affecting financial markets as well. We test our argument using data on U.S. President Donald J. Trump's Mexico-related policy tweets and the U.S. dollar/Mexican peso exchange rate. We find that Trump's Mexico-related tweets raised Mexican peso volatility while his policy views were unknown as well as thereafter, as they signaled his resolve in carrying out his Mexico-related agenda. By helping politicians disseminate policy information to voters, and since voters hold governments accountable for their policy performance, social media allows investors to gather information about the likely policy direction and policy resolve of government, especially those of newcomers whose direction and resolve are unknown.},

A continuous process of multisensory integration and recalibration is responsible for maintaining a correspondence between the senses (e.g., vision, touch, audition) and, ultimately, a stable and coherent perception of our environment. This process depends on the plasticity of our sensory systems. The so-called ventriloquism aftereffect\textemdash a shift in the perceived localization of sounds presented alone after repeated exposure to spatially mismatched auditory and visual stimuli\textemdash is a clear example of this type of plasticity in the audiovisual domain. In a series of six studies with 24 participants each, we investigated an imagery-induced ventriloquism aftereffect in which imagining a visual stimulus elicits the same frequency-specific auditory aftereffect as actually seeing one. These results demonstrate that mental imagery can recalibrate the senses and induce the same cross-modal sensory plasticity as real sensory stimuli.},

We examine lay perceptions of virtue, and show that different psychological drivers of virtuous behavior are relevant for different types of actions. When evaluating non-moral virtuous behavior, such as choosing to skip dessert, attributions of virtue depend on perceived willpower (i.e., the extent to which someone overcomes temptation in service of acting virtuous). In contrast, when evaluating moral virtuous behavior, such as choosing to be faithful to a spouse, attributions of virtue depend on perceived purity (i.e., the extent to which someone lacks temptation to sin and thereby does not need to exert willpower in service of acting virtuously). Study 1 demonstrates that when people describe their own actions, they associate willpower with non-moral virtuous behavior, and purity with moral virtuous behavior. Studies 2 \& 3 examine judgments of others and show that as behaviors become moralized, people elevate the importance of purity relative to willpower when ascribing virtue. Finally, Study 4 examines perceptions of those who are ``reformed''\textemdash having eliminated their previous sinful desires such that they no longer feel tempted. For non-moral behaviors, reformed individuals are seen as strong-willed and thus highly virtuous. However, for moral behaviors, reformed individuals are still seen as somewhat impure, and are judged to be less virtuous than those have never felt tempted by a particular vice. These results underscore how construing behaviors in moral terms shifts what people consider to be virtuous.},

In this research, we investigated the extent to which presenting effectiveness information leads people to choose more effective charities. We found that even when effectiveness information is made easily comparable across options, it has a limited impact on choice. Specifically, people frequently choose less effective charity options when those options represent more subjectively preferred causes. In contrast to making a personal donation decision, outcome metrics are used to a much greater extent when choosing financial investments and when allocating aid resources as an agent of an organization.

In this paper, Shannon's entropy (H) is employed as a measure of behavioral inconsistency: it is a central measure of information theory that, applied to decision making, allows the estimation of behavioral preferences among a set of options. We scanned (functional magnetic resonance imaging, fMRI) 24 young (18\textendash 25 year) subjects (14 female) while performing a decision-making task, where monetary rewards were devalued by physical effort (minutes running in the treadmill) and risk. Twenty different pairs of options were presented nine times each, and H was calculated for each pair and subject. Behavioral analyses showed that subjective value (SV) significantly explained agents' preferences only in pairs with a low inconsistent response. Averaged response time positively correlated with H, confirming entropy as an indicator of choice difficulty. Group analyses on fMRI data revealed a cluster in the paracingulate cortex as the neural correlate of H. Besides, BOLD signal in the posterior cingulate correlated with the SV of the pair only in consistent decisions, confirming that SV loses its explanatory power on highly inconsistent decisions. Finally, the anterior and central cingulate were especially recruited when predicting a secured effortless reward, compared with a secured reward that involved a maximum effort. Our study shows that different regions of the cingulate cortex are involved in choice inconsistency, SV and processing effort costs.},

Many studies have shown that the ingroup is often perceived as more prototypical of a superordinate category than the outgroup (i.e., relative prototypicality effect). This higher perceived congruence (overlap) between ingroup and superordinate group representations should be reflected in individuals' information processing and memory regarding the superordinate group. The authors hypothesized that in recall paradigms (H1), individuals would initially show better memory for information from the superordinate group that is inconsistent (rather than consistent) with the ingroup stereotype. We assumed that in recognition paradigms (H2), individuals would be more likely to attribute information to the superordinate group if the information was consistent with ingroup vs. outgroup stereotypes. Finally, we hypothesized that in recognition paradigms, individuals would confuse the ingroup with the superordinate group more often than they would confuse the outgroup with the superordinate group (H3). Five experiments testing these hypotheses (N = 314) and using different groups and stimulus modalities generally support these assumptions. The findings suggest that perceivers initially engage in inconsistency processing when confronted with information from a superordinate group that contradicts their ingroup-based expectation. However, even though perceivers initially recall such information particularly well, they are not able to integrate contradictory information successfully. More generally, our findings indicate that the perceived overlap between ingroup and superordinate group representations affects individuals' memory and thus helps explain why the relative prototypicality effect is such a robust phenomenon.},

Using structural equation modeling to analyze data from a national survey, we found that special educators' perceptions of adequacy of planning time, workload manageability, stress, and emotional exhaustion mediated relationships between other working conditions and intent to stay. Specifically, special educators who reported that they (a) spent more time planning outside school (b) supervised more paraprofessionals, (c) had limited access to curricular resources, and (d) served more heterogeneous instructional groups were more likely to report having insufficient planning time, unmanageable workloads, stress, emotional exhaustion, and intent to leave.

Social psychological theories provide individual, group, and system-level explanations for why people could remain inactive. However, they often focus only on personally held attitudes and do not fully consider the dynamics of attitude formation in interactions. Based on 26 focus group discussions conducted in Brazil, Hungary, and the Netherlands, we explored how citizens explain political inaction. We used latent thematic analysis, informed by social psychological theories, to understand how people form opinions about their own and others' political inaction. In all three countries, the prevalent norm in the focus group discussions was that political inaction should be reduced but a lack of political efficacy constituted a core theme in explaining why people remain politically inactive. Depending on the sociopolitical context and how people self-categorized within the discussions, people blamed unresponsive governments, or cited personal fears of repercussions and cultural differences within and between countries as reasons for inaction. The findings and interpretations are discussed within a framework that extends and integrates previous perspectives on why people remain politically inactive.},

However, because the two kinds of moral inclinations were confounded with general action tendencies, it remains unclear whether language effects on moral judgments reflect genuine differences in people's sensitivity to consequences and norms, or broader differences in general action tendencies regardless of consequences and norms. Using the CNI model of moral decision-making, the current research (N = 634) demonstrates that foreign language reduces sensitivity to consequences and sensitivity to norms without affecting general action tendencies.

Deviations from study colors were modeled to generate two estimates of color memory: the variability of remembered colors\textemdash fidelity\textemdash and the probability of forgetting the color. Estimating model parameters using both maximum-likelihood estimation and Bayesian hierarchical modeling, we found that working memory had better fidelity than long-term memory (Experiments 1 and 2).

In four experiments we investigated the influence of social categorization and membership on economic decision-making and inequality aversion. Specifically, we used a modified version of the Third Party Ultimatum Game, in which participants played the role of responder and were instructed to make decisions for themselves or another individual (i.e. the receiver of the economic offer) who was an ingroup or outgroup member. Experiments 1\textendash 2 (N = 173) showed that the participants were more likely to accept unequal-advantageous offers when the receivers were ingroup rather than outgroup members. Experiment 3 (N = 121) supported previous findings and suggested the intervening role played by perceived intergroup competition. Experiment 4 (N = 61) explored the effect boundary conditions. Findings revealed that, even when responder's utility is linked to the receiver's utility, the receiver's membership exerted its influence when the responders were highly identified with the ingroup. A final small-scale meta-analysis confirmed the robustness of our findings. Taken together, these results integrate research on economic decision-making and intergroup bias and suggest that the utility target's membership can resolve the conflict between inequality aversion and utility maximization.},

  abstract = {Abstract Activation of the N-methyl-D-aspartate subtype of glutamate receptor (NMDA-R) represents a key functional process for memory formation. A decreased synthesis of the NMDA-R co-agonist d-serine was recently proposed to contribute to alterations of hippocampus-dependent memory mechanisms with ageing. Nevertheless, other pathways could also be involved and thus considered to be targets of interest to prevent cognitive ageing. Herein, we demonstrate that the Asc-1 subtype of neutral amino acid (nAA) transporters that regulates d-serine and glycine release from neurons could be viewed as one of these targets. At CA3/CA1 hippocampal synapses, Asc-1 activation did not modify basal glutamate neurotransmission either in adult or aged rats. In contrast, Asc-1 activation significantly increased NMDA-R-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) in both groups of animals and fully rescued the age-related LTP deficits. This rescue in aged animals was observed only when Asc-1 activation was selectively managed by d-Isoleucine (d-Ile), but not when less specifically driven by a mixture of nAA. Similarly, while any activation of Asc-1 improved the isolated NMDA-R-induced synaptic potentials in adult rats, only d-Ile was efficient in aged animals. Taken together, these results strengthen the interest in specifically targeting Asc-1 transporters to better cure age-associated memory decline.

  abstract = {Implicit social biases are ubiquitous and are known to influence social behavior. A core diagnostic criterion of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) is abnormal social behavior. We investigated the extent to which individuals with ASD might show a specific attenuation of implicit social biases, using Implicit Association Tests (IATs) involving social (gender, race) and nonsocial (nature, shoes) categories. High-functioning adults with ASD showed intact but reduced IAT effects relative to healthy control participants. We observed no selective attenuation of implicit social (vs. nonsocial) biases in our ASD population. To extend these results, we supplemented our healthy control data with data collected from a large online sample from the general population and explored correlations between autistic traits and IAT effects. We observed no systematic relationship between autistic traits and implicit social biases in our online and control samples. Taken together, these results suggest that implicit social biases, as measured by the IAT, are largely intact in ASD.},

  abstract = {Recent studies have shown that activation of the sexual system encourages enactment of relationship-initiating behaviors (Birnbaum et al., 2017). In four studies, we expand on this work to explore whether people are more inclined to lie to impress a potential partner following sexual priming. In all studies, participants were exposed to sexual stimuli (versus non-sexual stimuli) and then interacted with an opposite-sex stranger. In Study 1, unacquainted participants resolved a dilemma while each represented opposing positions. In Study 2, participants rated their preferences, and after viewing a confederate's preferences, re-rated them in a profile shown to the confederate. In Studies 3 and 4, participants reported their number of lifetime sexual partners in anonymous questionnaires and during a chat (Study 3) or while completing an online profile (Study 4). Results indicated that following sexual priming, participants were more likely to conform to the stranger's views (Studies 1 and 2) and reported fewer sexual partners during actual and potential online interactions than in the questionnaires (Study 3). Although the results of Study 4 did not replicate the findings of Study 3, they were directionally consistent with them. Overall, the findings suggest that sexual priming motivates impression management even when it involves lying.},

  abstract = {Do voters polarize ideologically when radical views gain political legitimacy, or does the rise of radical voices merely reflect societal conflict? We argue that elite polarization as signaled by radical parties' first entrance into parliament leads to voter divergence. Immediately after the election, legitimization and backlash effects mean that voters on both ideological sides move toward the extremes. In the longer term, this polarization is solidified because of radical parties' parliamentary presence. A panel study of Dutch voters shows that the 2002 parliamentary entrance of a radical-right party indeed led to immediate ideological polarization across the political spectrum. Estimating time-series cross-sectional models on Eurobarometer data from 17 countries (1973\textendash 2016) shows an additional long-term impact of radical-right party entry on polarization. The presence of radical voices on the right has polarizing effects, illustrating how such institutional recognition and legitimization can have a far-reaching impact on society.},

In this article, I show why this approach can yield misleading conclusions about citizen competence. I argue that although citizens with strong partisan loyalties might be forced to accept the same facts, they find alternative ways to rationalize reality. One such way, I show, is through the selective attribution of credit and blame. With four randomized experiments, conducted in diverse national settings and containing closed- as well as open-ended questions, I find that as partisans correctly updated economic beliefs to reflect new facts, they conversely attributed responsibility in a highly selective fashion. Although partisans might acknowledge the same facts, they are apt in seizing on and producing attributional arguments that fit their preferred worldviews.},

For example, an oft-documented finding is that citizens tend to view the state of the national economy more positively if their party holds office. These partisan perceptual gaps are usually taken as a result of citizens' own motivated reasoning to defend their party identity. However, little is known about the extent to which perceptual gaps are shaped by one of the most important forces in politics: partisan elites. With two studies focusing on perceptions of the economy\textemdash a quasi-experimental panel study and a randomized experiment\textemdash we show how partisan perceptual differences are substantially affected by messages coming from party elites.

  abstract = {A significant comorbidity exists between alcohol and methamphetamine (Meth) abuse but the neurochemical consequences of this co-abuse are unknown. Alcohol and Meth independently and differentially affect glutamatergic transmission but the unique effects of their serial exposure on glutamate signaling in mediating damage to dopamine neurons are unknown. Sprague\textendash Dawley rats had intermittent voluntary access to 10\% ethanol (EtOH) every other day and water over 28 days and were then administered a binge injection regimen of Meth or saline. EtOH drinking decreased the glutamate aspartate transporter and increased basal extracellular concentrations of glutamate within the striatum when measured after the last day of drinking. Ceftriaxone is known to increase the expression and/or activity of glutamate transporters in the brain and prevented both the decreases in glutamate aspartate transporter and the increases in basal extracellular glutamate when administered during EtOH drinking. EtOH drinking also exacerbated the acute increases in extracellular glutamate observed upon Meth exposure, the subsequent increases in spectrin proteolysis, and the long-term decreases in dopamine content in the striatum, all of which were attenuated by ceftriaxone administration during EtOH drinking only. These results implicate EtOH-induced increases in extracellular glutamate and corresponding decreases in glutamate uptake as mechanisms that contribute to the vulnerability produced by EtOH drinking and the unique neurotoxicity observed after serial exposure to Meth that is not observed with either drug alone.

  abstract = {It is well established that emotion and cognition interact in humans, but such an interaction has not been extensively studied in nonhuman primates. We investigated whether emotional value can affect nonhuman primates' processing of stimuli that are only mentally represented, not visually available. In a short-term memory task, baboons memorized the location of two target squares of the same color, which were presented with a distractor of a different color. Through prior long-term conditioning, one of the two colors had acquired a negative valence. Subjects were slower and less accurate on the memory task when the targets were negative than when they were neutral. In contrast, subjects were faster and more accurate when the distractors were negative than when they were neutral. Some of these effects were modulated by individual differences in emotional disposition. Overall, the results reveal a pattern of cognitive avoidance of negative stimuli, and show that emotional value alters cognitive processing in baboons even when the stimuli are not physically present. This suggests that emotional influences on cognition are deeply rooted in evolutionary continuity.},

Only a subset of channels in the inferior segment of the circular sulcus of the insula showed HFA deviance detection responses, i.e., a greater and longer latency response to specific deviants relative to standards. Auditory deviancy processing was also later in the insula when compared with the superior temporal cortex. ERP results were more widespread and supported the HFA insular findings.

In a sample of 411 children between the ages of 6 and 14 years, we found consistent gender differences in endorsement of communal and agentic values. Across this age range, boys endorsed communal values less and agentic values more than did girls. Moreover, gender differences in values partially accounted for boys' relatively lower family versus career orientation, predicting their orientation over and above gender identification and parent reports of children's gender expression. These findings suggest that gender differences in core values emerge surprisingly early in development and predict children's expectations well before they make decisions about adopting adult roles in their own families.},

The current research investigates whether and why people perceive gender imbalances in male-dominated careers (STEM and leadership) as more problematic than gender imbalances in female-dominated, caregiving careers (HEED). Results from four studies (total N = 754) document a tendency to more strongly support the inclusion of women in male-dominated careers, compared to the inclusion of men in female-dominated careers. This asymmetry in support for social action towards change is predicted by beliefs about what the ideal gender representation should be and the perceived causes of gender imbalances in each career type. Notably, gender representation in careers (and not salary) is the key factor underlying discrepant support for change (Study 4).},

  abstract = {Access to WM can be restricted on the basis of goal-relevant properties such as spatial location. However, the extent of voluntary control over which features of an attended multi-feature object are encoded and maintained in WM is debated. Some evidence suggests that attending to an object leads to obligatory storage of all of its features, whereas other evidence suggests that access to WM can be restricted to only goal-relevant features. Another possibility is that all features are initially encoded, but irrelevant features are removed from WM over time. To address these various possibilities, we used pattern classification of EEG signals to track the temporal evolution of representations reflecting the encoding and storage of task-relevant and irrelevant features in WM. In different blocks, participants remembered the orientation, color or both orientation and color of a colored, oriented grating. The color and orientation of the grating was randomly drawn from two distinct feature bins on each trial. To examine trial-specific activity reflecting storage of the object's features, a support vector machine (SVM) classifier was trained to classify what bin the stimulus features came from. Importantly, for orientation, the classifier produced reliably above-chance classification across the delay when orientation was task-relevant but not when it was task-irrelevant. Interestingly, orientation could be accurately classified on trials for which both orientation and color were remembered. Moreover, a separate measure corresponding to the probability of a feature belonging to the correct bin was significantly higher when orientation was task-relevant compared to task-irrelevant during encoding. Above-chance classification for color was only present during the initial 500~msec across all conditions. Our results suggest that although information about all of an object's features is present in the initial stimulus-evoked neural response, information about the task-irrelevant features is attenuated during stimulus encoding and is largely absent throughout the delay.},

  abstract = {In psychology, researchers are often interested in the predictive classification of individuals. Various models exist for such a purpose, but which model is considered a best practice is conditional on attributes of the data. Under certain conditions, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) has been shown to perform better than other predictive methods, such as logistic regression, multinomial logistic regression, random forests, support-vector machines, and the K-nearest neighbor algorithm. The purpose of this Tutorial is to provide researchers who already have a basic level of statistical training with a general overview of LDA and an example of its implementation and interpretation. Decisions that must be made when conducting an LDA (e.g., prior specification, choice of cross-validation procedures) and methods of evaluating case classification (posterior probability, typicality probability) and overall classification (hit rate, Huberty's I index) are discussed. LDA for prediction is described from a modern Bayesian perspective, as opposed to its original derivation. A step-by-step example of implementing and interpreting LDA results is provided. All analyses were conducted in R, and the script is provided; the data are available online.},

  abstract = {Abstract The present study examined the role of person?group dissimilarity in personality in peer victimization. It was hypothesized that adolescents who show more deviation from the classroom norm in personality experience more peer victimization. Data from 1108 adolescents (48\% boys; Mage~=~13.56~years, SD~=~1.13) from 54 classrooms were used to test this hypothesis. Data included measurements of self?reported and bully?disclosed victimization and Big Five and Dark Triad personality traits. Results of generalized linear mixed models including polynomial equations and subsequent response surface analyses partly supported our hypothesis. Person?group dissimilarity in the shape of personality profiles was related to more bully?disclosed victimization, but not to self?reported victimization. Dissimilarity in neuroticism and Machiavellianism was related to both more self?reported and bully?disclosed victimization. Dissimilarity in extraversion, openness to experience, and psychopathy was only related to more self?reported victimization. Unexpectedly, dissimilarity in agreeableness was related to less self?reported victimization. Moreover, our results also indicated that certain levels of congruent person?group combinations in agreeableness, neuroticism, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy were related to more peer victimization. Overall, findings of this study emphasize the importance of considering classroom norms in relation to peer victimization. Copyright ? 2017 European Association of Personality Psychology},

The present study examines the predictions of SIT by focusing on the transition from student life to working life. We analysed three-wave longitudinal data and compared participants who made the transition into working life (N = 226), participants who combined education with work (N = 387), and participants who did not make the transition at all (N = 287). In contrast to the predictions of SIT, we found no differences in personality maturation between individuals who made the transition into working life and those who did this only partly or not at all. Psychological commitment to work did not explain individual differences in personality maturation for those who made the transition (partly) into working life after controlling for multiple testing. Therefore, the present study did not support the predictions of SIT. \textcopyright{} 2019 The Authors European Journal of Personality published by John Wiley \& Sons Ltd on behalf of European Association of Personality Psychology},

While previous studies posit that such biases are driven by politicians' motivations to target benefits directly to certain groups of ordinary voters, this article develops the argument that national politicians also target pork along partisan lines to win over politicians at lower levels of government whose cooperation they need to ensure the successful implementation of development projects. Using a quasi-experimental design, the argument is tested with data on thousands of public works projects sanctioned by MPs in North India. The results show that, even controlling for unobserved differences in voter characteristics, MPs systematically favored the constituencies of co-partisan state legislators when allocating pork specifically under conditions implied by the argument and not otherwise. These results shed new light on the reasons for partisan biases in resource allocation in multilevel systems.},

Although a number of studies have investigated visual patterns in relation to                     the perceiver's interest, intentions, and goals, little is known about eye gaze                     when it comes to differentiating intentions to love from intentions to lust                     (sexual desire). To address this question, we conducted two experiments: one                     testing whether the visual pattern related to the perception of love differs                     from that related to lust and one testing whether the visual pattern related to                     the expression of love differs from that related to lust.

  abstract = {The present study explored how motor cortical activity was influenced by visual perception of complex environments that either afforded or obstructed arm and leg reactions in young, healthy adults. Most importantly, we focused on compensatory balance reactions where the arms were required to regain stability following unexpected postural perturbation. Our first question was if motor cortical activity from the hand area automatically corresponds to the visual environment. Affordance-based priming of the motor system was assessed using single-pulse Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) to determine if visual access to a wall-mounted support handle influenced corticospinal excitability. We evaluated if hand actions were automatically facilitated and/or suppressed by viewing an available handle within graspable range. Our second question was if the requirement for rapid movement to recover balance played a role in modulating any affordance effect in the hands. The goal was to disentangle motor demands related to postural threat from the impact of observation alone. For balance trials, a custom-built, lean and release apparatus was used to impose temporally unpredictable postural perturbations. In all balance trials, perturbations were of sufficient magnitude to evoke a compensatory change-in-support response; therefore, any recovery action needed to carefully take into account the affordances and constraints of the perceived environment to prevent a fall. Consistent with our first hypothesis, activity in an intrinsic hand muscle was increased when participants passively viewed a wall-mounted safety handle, in both seated and standing contexts. Contrary to our second hypothesis, this visual priming was absent when perturbations were imposed and the handle was needed to regain balance. Our results reveal that motor set is influenced by simply viewing objects that afford a grasp. We suggest that such preparation may provide an advantage when generating balance recovery actions that require quickly grasping a supportive handle. This priming effect likely competes with other task-dependent influences that regulate cortical motor output. Future studies should expand from limitations inherent with single-pulse TMS alone, to determine if vision of our surrounding world influences motor set in other contexts (e.g., intensified postural threat) and investigate if this priming corresponds to overt behavior.},

Rather than use unsupervised methods to recover a latent dimension that best explains patterns in giving, donation patterns are instead mapped onto a target measure of legislative voting behavior. Supervised models significantly outperform alternative measures of ideology in predicting legislative voting behavior. Fundraising prior to entering office provides a highly informative signal about future voting behavior. Impressively, forecasts based on fundraising as a nonincumbent predict future voting behavior as accurately as in-sample forecasts based on votes cast during a legislator's first 2 years in Congress. The combined results demonstrate campaign contributions are powerful predictors of roll-call voting behavior and resolve an ongoing debate as to whether contribution data successfully distinguish between members of the same party.},

  abstract = {Loss of function mutations in the PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (Pink1) gene have been linked with an autosomal recessive familial form of early onset Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the underlying mechanism(s) responsible for degeneration remains elusive. Presently, using co-immunoprecipitation in HEK (Human embryonic kidney) 293 cells, we show that Pink1 endogenously interacts with FK506-binding protein 51 (FKBP51 or FKBP5), FKBP5 and directly phosphorylates FKBP5 at Serine in an in vitro kinase assay. Both FKBP5 and Pink1 have been previously associated with protein kinase B (AKT) regulation. We provide evidence using primary cortical cultured neurons from Pink1-deficient mice that Pink1 increases AKT phosphorylation at Serine 473 (Ser473) challenged by 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) and that over-expression of FKBP5 using an adeno-associated virus delivery system negatively regulates AKT phosphorylation at Ser473 in murine-cultured cortical neurons. Interestingly, FKBP5 over-expression promotes death in response to MPP+ in the absence of Pink1. Conversely, shRNA-mediated knockdown of FKBP5 in cultured cortical neurons is protective and this effect is reversed with inhibition of AKT signaling. In addition, shRNA down-regulation of PH domain leucine-rich repeat protein phosphatase (PHLPP) in Pink1 WT neurons increases neuronal survival, while down-regulation of PHLPP in Pink1 KO rescues neuronal death in response to MPP+. Finally, using co-immunoprecipitation, we show that FKBP5 interacts with the kinase AKT and phosphatase PHLPP. This interaction is increased in the absence of Pink1, both in Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts (MEF) and in mouse brain tissue. Expression of kinase dead Pink1 (K219M) enhances FKBP5 interaction with both AKT and PHLPP. Overall, our results suggest a testable model by which Pink1 could regulate AKT through phosphorylation of FKBP5 and interaction of AKT with PHLPP. Our results suggest a potential mechanism by which PINK1-FKBP5 pathway contributes to neuronal death in PD.

  abstract = {Since the 1960s, researchers have been reporting that stress reduces Stroop interference. This is puzzling, as stress and anxiety typically have deleterious effects on cognitive control and performance. The traditional explanation is that stress reduces ``cue utilisation'': It withdraws attentional resources from less relevant stimuli (including the distracter word), meaning that the target colour is left with a stronger influence over response selection. However, it could also be that stress somehow boosts distracter inhibition, or some other aspect of executive control. To test these two accounts, 59 students completed a Stroop task featuring occasional startlingly loud sounds (high stress) or the same sounds at a lower, comfortable volume (low stress). Alongside standard Stroop interference, two measures of executive control\textemdash negative priming and conflict adaptation\textemdash were calculated from the Stroop data. Stress produced a clear reduction of Stroop interference, but it did not influence negative priming, and no conflict adaptation effects were detected at all. These findings support the cue utilisation account. Furthermore, for the first time, stress was shown to reduce Stroop interference in a task with no congruent trials, showing that the effect does not result from stress's modulating any strategy changes participants might make in response to congruent trials.},

Data came from Dutch mothers (N~=~483; M age~=~44~years at T1) who completed up to six yearly personality questionnaires and 15 between-year assessment bursts, lasting five consecutive days each. Using multilevel structural equation modelling, we found that individual differences in daily experiences of positive affect and perceived relationship support/affection with partners and children were positively associated with subsequent rank-order changes in all Big Five personality traits. In contrast, we found little evidence that personality traits were associated with rank-order changes in daily experiences, which may be due to the very-high rank-order stability of positive affect and relationship support. Furthermore, positive daily experiences demonstrated incremental validity in predicting rank-order changes in trait agreeableness, emotional stability, and openness, over and above daily negative affect and relationship conflict. The results suggest that positive affective and interpersonal daily experiences contribute to positive personality trait changes in middle adulthood.

We can improve our understanding of the effect of power-sharing institutions by analyzing the mechanisms under which they operate. To this effect, we compare the direct effect of formal power-sharing institutions on peace with their indirect effect through power-sharing behavior. Combining data on inclusive and territorially dispersive institutions with information on power-sharing behavior, we empirically assess this relationship on a global scale. Our causal mediation analysis reveals that formal power-sharing institutions affect the probability of ethnic conflict onset mostly through power-sharing behavior that these institutions induce.},

However, whether people's responses to these dilemmas truly reflect the decisions they would make in real life is unclear. In the current study, participants had to make the real-life decision to administer an electroshock (that they did not know was bogus) to a single mouse or allow five other mice to receive the shock. Our results indicate that responses to hypothetical dilemmas are not predictive of real-life dilemma behavior, but they are predictive of affective and cognitive aspects of the real-life decision. Furthermore, participants were twice as likely to refrain from shocking the single mouse when confronted with a hypothetical versus the real version of the dilemma. We argue that hypothetical-dilemma research, while valuable for understanding moral cognition, has little predictive value for actual behavior and that future studies should investigate actual moral behavior along with the hypothetical scenarios dominating the field.},

  abstract = {Functional neuroimaging studies have attempted to explore brain activity that occurs with tic occurrence in subjects with Tourette syndrome (TS). However, they are limited by the difficulty of disambiguating brain activity required to perform a tic, or activity caused by the tic, from brain activity that generates a tic. Inhibiting ticcing following the urge to tic is important to patients' experience of tics and we hypothesize that inhibition of a compelling motor response to a natural urge will differ in TS subjects compared to controls. This study examines the urge to blink, which shares many similarities to premonitory urges to tic. Previous neuroimaging studies with the same hypothesis have used a one-size-fits-all approach to extract brain signal putatively linked to the urge to blink. We aimed to create a subject-specific and blink-timing-specific pathophysiological model, derived from out-of-scanner blink suppression trials, to eventually better interpret blink suppression fMRI data. Eye closure and continuously self-reported discomfort were reported during five blink suppression trials in 30 adult volunteers, 15 with a chronic tic disorder. For each subject, data from four of the trials were used with an empirical mathematical model to predict discomfort from eye closure observed during the remaining trial. The blink timing model of discomfort during blink suppression predicted observed discomfort much better than previously applied models. Combining this approach with observed eye closure during fMRI blink suppression trials should therefore extract brain signal more tightly linked to the urge to blink. The simple mean of time-discomfort curves from each subject's other trials also outperformed older models. The TS group blinked more than twice as often during the blink suppression block, and reported higher baseline discomfort, smaller excursion from baseline to peak discomfort during the blink suppression block, and slower return of discomfort to baseline during the recovery block.},

Strategies for doing so include emphasizing candidates' racial/ethnic identity and securing endorsements from racial/ethnic groups. While many scholars focus on candidates' racial/ethnic attributes, ethnic group endorsements are understudied. Whether such endorsements induce voters to choose ideologically similar candidates (spatial voting), or choose based on race/ethnicity (racial voting) is unclear. We address this question by examining elections in multiethnic local settings. Using original surveys and exit polls, we create comparable measures of candidate and voter ideology, and examine how race/ethnicity and ideology affect voters' choices. We also embed experiments that manipulate ethnic group endorsements. We find that ideology influences voters' choices, but that ethnic group endorsements weaken spatial voting. The latter effect among whites is driven by racial/ethnic stereotypes. These reactions explain why some candidates seek such endorsements and why others might prefer to avoid them.},

We demonstrate that endorsements from particularly well-connected interest groups are a strong cue for members with limited information early in the legislative process and help grow the list of bill cosponsors. As bills progress, such groups have less direct weight, while legislation supported by a larger number of organizations and a larger number of cosponsors is more likely to pass. Thus, we illuminate the usage of Dear Colleague letters in Congress, demonstrate how members use interest groups in the legislative process, and shed new light on the varying impact of groups on public policy.},

However, prior work has almost exclusively focused on ``first'' impressions, overlooking that social interactions require flexible updating of initial evaluations. Three experiments tested whether impression updating is influenced by morality, sociability, and competence characteristics to the same extent. Participants were asked to revise their impressions of an individual in light of new and inconsistent information pertaining to his morality, sociability or competence. Results showed that morality was perceived as more informative of interpersonal intentions; therefore a greater impression change occurred when moral information (vs. sociability or competence information) was added to what was previously learned about an individual. Our findings reveal that the key role of morality in social cognition goes beyond the formation of initial evaluations by influencing the updating of such first impressions.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces a statistical technique known as ``posterior passing'' in which the results of past studies can be used to inform the analyses carried out by subsequent studies. We first describe the technique in detail and show how it can be implemented by individual researchers on an experiment by experiment basis. We then use a simulation to explore its success in identifying true parameter values compared to current statistical norms (ANOVAs and GLMMs). We find that posterior passing allows the true effect in the population to be found with greater accuracy and consistency than the other analysis types considered. Furthermore, posterior passing performs almost identically to a data analysis in which all data from all simulated studies are combined and analysed as one dataset. On this basis, we suggest that posterior passing is a viable means of implementing cumulative science. Furthermore, because it prevents the accumulation of large bodies of conflicting literature, it alleviates the need for traditional meta-analyses. Instead, posterior passing cumulatively and collaboratively provides clarity in real time as each new study is produced and is thus a strong candidate for a new, cumulative approach to scientific analyses and publishing.},

To account for these findings, it has been proposed that exposure to expectancy-violating information enhances attention to context, which leads to an integration of the context into the representation of expectancy-violating counterattitudinal information. Although a considerable body of evidence supports these assumptions, it is still unclear whether contextualized attitude change is a general phenomenon that is robust across individuals or instead depends on psychological characteristics of the perceiver. To address this question, the current research tested whether contextualized attitude change is moderated by three individual difference variables that are known to influence responses to belief-incongruent information: preference for consistency, need for structure, and implicit theories of personality. Based on the hypothesis that contextualized attitude change is due to enhanced attention to context during encoding of expectancy-violating information, we hypothesized that individual differences along the three dimensions should moderate contextualized attitude change via differences in attention to context in response to expectancy-violating information. Contrary to this hypothesis, none of the three variables moderated contextualized attitude change (Experiments 1 and 2) and attention to context during exposure to expectancy-violating information (Experiment 3). Implications for the generality of contextualized attitude change, research on the three individual difference variables, and cognitive consistency more broadly are discussed.},

  abstract = {What factors contribute to children's tendency to view individuals as having different traits and abilities? The present research tested whether young children are influenced by adults' nonverbal behaviors when making inferences about peers. In Study 1, participants (aged 5\textendash 6 years) viewed multiple videos of interactions between a ``teacher'' and two ``students''; all individuals were unfamiliar to participants. In each clip, the students behaved similarly, but the teacher did not: She either smiled, nodded, touched, or shook her head at one student, and she looked at the other student with a neutral expression. In Study 1, children tended to infer that students who received more positive behaviors from the teacher were smarter, nicer, and stronger. Study 2 pitted differences in the teacher's behavior against differences in the students' performance. When asked who was smarter, children selected lower-performing students who received more positive nonverbal cues from the teacher rather than higher-performing students who received less positive cues. These findings indicate that an authority figure's nonverbal behaviors can influence children's inferences about others and shed light on one mechanism guiding young children's evaluations of people in their social world.},

While daily datasets extend for several centuries in parts of the Northern Hemisphere, the majority of historical data for the Southern Hemisphere are monthly averages or totals. In this paper, we describe a newly recovered dataset of ten daily meteorological variables for 1877 to 1922 from Eversleigh, a property in the New England region of New South Wales in Australia. Here, we present the full process of data rescue, from digitization to quality control and an assessment of homogeneity. We show that the majority of variables were recorded to a high standard and that the data are of general use for climate analysis. Forty years of daily temperature, cloud cover, wind, and pressure observations are now available for the New England Plateau, offering data that are more complete than any other records for the region in the Australian Bureau of Meteorology dataset. The Eversleigh dataset now provides an opportunity to gain more insight into the 19th century weather and climate of eastern Australia during a time of large interannual climate variability before the dominant impact of an anthropogenic warming signal.},

However, there is limited evidence about whether and why debates influence voters in new democracies. We use a field experiment on parliamentary debates during Ghana's 2016 elections to show that debates improve voters' evaluations of candidates. Debates have the strongest effect on partisan voters, who become more favorable toward and more likely to vote for opponent-party candidates and less likely to vote for co-partisans. Experimental and unique observational data capturing participants' second-by-second reactions to the debates show that policy information was the most important causal mechanism driving partisan moderation, especially among strong partisans. A follow-up survey shows that these effects persist in electorally competitive communities, whereas they dissipate in party strongholds. Policy-centered debates have the potential to reduce partisan polarization in new democracies, but the local political context conditions the persistence of these effects.},

Our results inform a long-standing debate about the role of morality and ethics in leadership and have important implications for electing effective government officials.

However, there has been little work to identify different cognitive processes that may be underpinning these delayed memory deficits for mTBI. Frontal cortex is important for delayed memory, and is implicated in the pathophysiology of mTBI; moreover, frontal lobes are typically considered the locus of executive abilities. To further explore these relationships, we sought to partly explain delayed memory deficits after mTBI by examining behavioral indicators of executive function. Results showed that sub-acute as well as chronic mTBI patients performed worse than controls on the delayed memory trial of the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (Brandt \& Benedict, 2001), recalling approximately 18\% and 15\% fewer words, respectively. Furthermore, worse delayed memory performance was associated with less use of the cognitive strategy of semantic clustering, and with lower scores for the executive function composite from a standardized neuropsychological battery (NIH EXAMINER; Kramer et~al., 2014). In contrast, serial clustering, a memory organizational strategy thought to be less dependent on executive function, did not show strong relationships to clinical status or delayed memory performance. This exploratory work suggests novel hypotheses to be tested in future, confirmatory studies, including that general executive functions and/or semantic clustering will mediate delayed memory deficits following mTBI.},

In this longitudinal study, we followed 5-year-olds born close to the official cutoff date for entry into first grade and compared those who subsequently entered first grade that year with those who remained in kindergarten, which is more play oriented. The first graders made larger improvements in accuracy on an executive-function test over the year than did the kindergartners. In an independent functional MRI task, we found that the first graders, compared with the kindergartners, exhibited a greater increase in activation of right posterior parietal cortex, a region previously implicated in sustained attention; increased activation in this region was correlated with the improvement in accuracy. These results reveal how the environmental context of formal schooling shapes brain mechanisms underlying improved focus on cognitively demanding tasks.},

  abstract = {Abstract Quantitative approaches to climate risk management such as mapping or impact modelling rely on past meteorological data with daily or sub-daily resolution, a large fraction of which have not yet been digitized. Over the last decade or so, a number of projects have contributed to the rescue of some of these data. Here we provide a summary of a survey we have undertaken of several meteorological and climate data rescue projects, in order to identify the needs of climate data rescue services. To make these efforts more sustainable, additional integrated activities are needed. We argue that meteorological and climate data rescue must be seen as a continuous, coordinated long-term effort. Technical developments (e.g. data assimilation), new scientific questions (e.g. process understanding of extreme events) and new social (e.g. risk assessment, health) or economic (e.g. new renewable energy sources, agriculture and forestry, tourism, infrastructure, etc.) services are highlighting the immense value of data previously neglected or never considered. This continuous effort is currently undertaken by projects of various sizes, structure, funding and staffing, as well as by dedicated programmes, ranging from those within many national weather services down to ?grassroots? initiatives. These activities are often not sufficiently coordinated, staffed, or funded at an international level and will benefit considerably from climate data rescue services being established within the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) (https://climate.copernicus.eu/).

Many accounts implicitly assume economic elites are homogeneous and that increases in their political power will increase inequality. We shed new light on heterogeneity in economic elites' political preferences, arguing that economic elites from an industry can share distinctive preferences due in part to sharing distinctive predispositions. Consequently, how increases in economic elites' influence affect inequality depends on which industry's elites are gaining influence and which policy issues are at stake. We demonstrate our argument with four original surveys, including the two largest political surveys of American economic elites to date: one of technology entrepreneurs\textemdash whose influence is burgeoning\textemdash and another of campaign donors. We show that technology entrepreneurs support liberal redistributive, social, and globalistic policies but conservative regulatory policies\textemdash a bundle of preferences rare among other economic elites. These differences appear to arise partly from their distinctive predispositions.},

This study charted the time course of monitoring in monolingual English speakers and bilingual Dutch\textendash English speakers in language production and language comprehension, with the aim of pinpointing the component(s) of monitoring that cause an L2 disadvantage. First, we asked whether phonological errors are interrupted more slowly in L2. An analysis of data from three speech error elicitation experiments indeed showed that Dutch\textendash English bilinguals were slower to stop speaking after an error had been detected in their L2 (English) than in their L1 (Dutch), at least for interrupted errors. A similar L2 disadvantage was found when comparing the L2 of Dutch\textendash English bilinguals to the L1 of English monolinguals. Second, monolingual English speakers and bilingual Dutch\textendash English speakers performed a picture naming task, a production monitoring task, and a comprehension monitoring task. Bilingual English speakers were slower in naming pictures in their L2 than monolingual English speakers. However, the production monitoring task and comprehension monitoring task yielded comparable response latencies between monolinguals in their L1 and bilinguals in their L2, indicating that monitoring processes in L2 are not generally slower. We suggest that interruption and repair are planned concurrently and that the difficulty of repairing in L2 triggers a slow-down in L2 interruption.},

One correlational and two experimental studies provide support for this hypothesis among low (but not high) SES high school and university students. Implications for future intervention efforts are discussed.},

Across six studies, we discovered a reversal of the bias depending on contextual and personal factors. Strivers, rather than naturals, are favored when evaluating ordinary people. This preference is particularly strong among perceivers who have experience in the performance domain, and it replicates across different domains and participant populations. Strivers are also preferred as cooperative partners and are expected to perform better on novel, unrelated tasks. The direction of the preference for naturals versus strivers can be traced to a combination of the perceiver's experience and the target's professional status. Specifically, a naturalness bias was only present among experienced perceivers evaluating professional targets. On the other hand, a more implicit form of the naturalness bias was observed in attributions made about the target's achievement, such that strivers were assumed to have natural talent more than naturals were assumed to have worked diligently.},

Although most Americans indicate that they would prefer greater equality, redistributive policies aimed at reducing inequality are frequently unpopular. Traditional accounts posit that attitudes toward redistribution are driven by economic self-interest or ideological principles. From a social psychological perspective, however, we expected that subjective comparisons with other people may be a more relevant basis for self-interest than is material wealth. We hypothesized that participants would support redistribution more when they felt low than when they felt high in subjective status, even when actual resources and self-interest were held constant. Moreover, we predicted that people would legitimize these shifts in policy attitudes by appealing selectively to ideological principles concerning fairness. In four studies, we found correlational (Study 1) and experimental (Studies 2\textendash 4) evidence that subjective status motivates shifts in support for redistributive policies along with the ideological principles that justify them.},

The dataset includes a total of 35,364 daily series of maximum and minimum temperature obtained from seven different collections. About 97\% of the series are publicly available in a common format, while the remaining 3\% can be obtained from the original data providers. Unlike other similar products, duplicates have been removed without blending of series, which simplifies data traceability and improves the temporal homogeneity of the individual series at the cost of a smaller average length. Residual artificial signals (breakpoints) in the series caused by station relocations, changes in instrumentation, etc., have been detected by means of the combination of four breakpoint detection tests, four variables and three temporal aggregations. The combined results give not only the most probable position of the breakpoints, but also a measure of their likelihood. The reliability of the detection was estimated for each year of each target series, based on the number of reference series and on their correlation with the target series. Moreover, its general performance was evaluated through a benchmark of synthetic series. This product will be combined with datasets of marine and ice in situ air temperature observations and with measurements from satellite to produce the first complete global statistical reconstruction of daily near-surface air temperature.},

  abstract = {Romantic relationships are known to be very influential, but less is known about how these relationships, and particularly the breakup of these relationships, may affect individuals' relational schemas, or their expectations for relationships. Undergraduate students reported on how their views of themselves, romantic partners, and relationships changed after breaking up with a past partner. Results suggest that relational schemas change following relationship dissolution and that there are both positive and negative aspects to this change. There was also some evidence that aspects of the past relationship predicted change and the valence of change, and that change and the valence of change were related to aspects of current relationship quality. These results are an important first step in understanding how past romantic relationships influence people's expectations about relationships and, by extension, their health and wellbeing.},

Using a set of 36 recorded laughs produced by female English speakers in tests involving 884 participants from 21 societies across six regions of the world, we asked listeners to determine whether each laugh was real or fake, and listeners differentiated between the two laugh types with an accuracy of 56\% to 69\%.

U.S. study abroad students (N = 19) recorded group conversations with native speakers (N = 10) at the beginning, middle, and end of a 6-week stay in Barcelona, Spain. Results indicate a significant decrease in the provision of corrective feedback by both native speakers and peer learners over the course of the program. Qualitative analyses revealed that both learners and natives alike engage in negotiations for meaning throughout the program, which for learners resulted in successful recall on tailor-made quizzes. The use of the first language by both the study abroad students and the native speakers promoted these opportunities in some instances. Results are discussed in terms of their contribution to the study abroad literature as well as to research into the effects of feedback on second language development.},

Here, we examined a previously unexplored domain: speech motor learning. We investigated whether speech motor learning in unimpaired participants can be enhanced using a single-session tDCS experiment, and investigated whether the timing of tDCS relative to a behavioral task affected performance. Participants (N~=~80) performed a twenty minute learning task with nonwords containing non-native consonant clusters (e.g., GDEEVOO), and were assigned to groups receiving either sham or active tDCS either immediately before or during the task. Both accuracy and properties of errors were examined throughout the course of the practice task, and then practice was compared to a retention period 30~min later (R1) and two days later (R2). For cluster and whole-(non)word accuracy measures, acquisition was observed for all groups during the practice session. Compared to the beginning of practice, the tDCS-Before group showed significantly greater improvement than both the sham group and the tDCS-During group at R1. An effect was also observed for vowel duration in errors (/gdivu/~\textrightarrow ~[g{$\Elzschwa$}divu]), with the tDCS-Before group showing significant shortening of vowel errors throughout practice. Overall, the findings suggest that tDCS can improve speech motor learning, and that the improvement may be greater when tDCS is applied immediately before practice, warranting further exploration of this new domain for tDCS research.},

Interestingly, there is evidence that the way in which the volume of an object is experienced can affect the strength of the illusion, with a SWI induced by exclusively haptic volume cues feeling stronger than a SWI induced with only visual volume cues. Furthermore, visual cues appear to add nothing over and above haptic size cues in terms of the strength of the induced weight illusion\textendash findings which are difficult to reconcile with work using cue-conflict paradigms where visual cues usually dominate haptic cues. Here, virtual reality was used to place these senses in conflict with one another. Participants (N\,=\,22) judged the heaviness of identically weighted cylinders across three conditions: (1) objects appeared different sizes but were physically the same size, (2) objects were physically different sizes but appeared to be the same size, or (3) objects which looked and felt different sizes from one another. Consistent with prior work, haptic size cues induced a larger SWI than that induced by visual size differences. In contrast to prior work, however, congruent vision and haptic size cues yielded a larger still SWI. These findings not only add to our understanding of how different modalities combine to influence our hedonic perception but also showcase how virtual reality can develop novel cue-conflict paradigms.},

To better understand how goals are embedded in people's lives across adulthood, the present research examined life goals' content (health, personal growth, prosocial engagement, social relations, status, work), dynamics (interplay between goal importance and goal attainability), and outcomes (subjective well-being) from a developmental perspective. We argue that people rate those goals as important and attainable that enable them to master developmental tasks, that they adapt their goals to personal capacities, and that goals predict subjective well-being after 2 and 4 years. The sample included 973 individuals (18\textendash 92 years old, M = 43.00 years) of whom 637 participated 2 years later and 573 participated 4 years later. Goal importance and well-being were assessed at all occasions and goal attainability at the first two occasions. Results indicated that age was negatively associated with importance and attainability of personal-growth, status, and work goals but positively associated with importance and attainability of prosocial-engagement goals. The association between goal importance and attainability was largely bidirectional over time; and goal attainability, rather than goal importance, was positively linked to later well-being.

  abstract = {The preparation of an action is accompanied by transient corticospinal (CS) excitability changes. Motivation can modulate these changes. Specifically, when a cue indicates that a reward can be obtained, CS excitability initially increases, followed by a pronounced decrease. This dynamic could reflect processes related to reward expectancy, processes related to action preparation, or a combination of both. Here we set up two experiments to dissociate these accounts. A rewarded choice reaction time task was used in which individuals were cued at the beginning of each trial whether or not a response would be required at target onset and whether or not a reward could be obtained. We used single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (spTMS) over the left primary motor cortex (M1) early (shortly after cue onset) or late (shortly before target onset) preceding target onset to examine CS excitability during motivated action preparation. Electromyography (EMG) was obtained from the right first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle. In the first experiment, we used a lenient response deadline, whereas a strict response time-out procedure was employed in the second experiment. Reward modulated CS excitability differentially only in the second experiment: CS excitability was highest during reward anticipation for the early stimulation epoch and was reduced for the late stimulation epoch when individuals were required to prepare a response, while CS excitability remained unchanged during non-reward anticipation. Our findings suggest that the reward effect on CS excitability is dependent on the actual implementation of effort to attain reward (i.e., the preparation of an actual action), as well as on temporal requirements (i.e., time pressure) invoked by the task.},

The appendices provide detailed mathematical derivations of the models and a discussion of censored ordinal models.

Building on this work, this study investigated whether depressed-affect symptoms influenced risky decision making under time pressure. The effect of depressed affect on risky choice was assessed in a reward (Experiments 1A and 1B) and loss (Experiment 2) context under low- and high-pressure conditions. Decisions involved learning to choose between a ``sure'' option and a ``risky'' option with identical expected values. In Experiment 1A, depressed affect predicted increased risky decision making under time pressure but did not affect decision making under low pressure. Experiment 1B replicated this effect. In contrast, in Experiment 2, depressed affect led to reduced risk taking in low-pressure condition but did not affect decision making under high pressure. These results suggest that the pattern of risky decision making among those experiencing symptoms of depressed affect depends on performance pressure demands.},

  abstract = {The Earned Dogmatism Hypothesis is that social norms entitle experts to behave in a close-minded fashion, and therefore that manipulations which increase perceived expertise reduce open-minded cognition. This manuscript reports direct replications of three key experiments reported by Ottati et al. 2015 in this journal in support of the Earned Dogmatism Hypothesis. Consistent with the original findings, it was found that dogmatic behavior is considered substantially more appropriate for experts relative to novices (d=0.45 [0.35, 0.55] over all replications and original study). In addition, it was confirmed that when participants envision themselves as experts they predict they will be more close-minded (d=-0.54 [-0.64, -0.44]). Unfortunately, replications involving manipulation of expertise through task difficulty showed little to no effect on open-minded cognition (d=0.00 [-0.21, 0.21] for easy/difficult recall task; d=-0.02 [-0.21, 0.17] for easy/difficult trivia task). The balance of evidence suggests that the Earned Dogmatism Hypothesis is currently well-supported only for prospective manipulations of expertise that require participants to predict their social behaviors.

  abstract = {Relationships with parents such as those addressed in attachment theory can dictate emotion processing and perception of situations. Namely, insecure parental attachment (i.e., higher attachment-based anxiety and avoidance scores; Fraley, Heffernan, Vicary, \& Brumbaugh, 2011b) can compromise emotion regulation and affect. However, although previous attachment research has addressed emotions during daily positive events (Gentzler, Kerns, \& Keener, 2010), to our knowledge no studies have evaluated participants' attachment in relation to their emotions during major positive life events that involve their parents (e.g., a wedding or holiday). Thus, the present study aimed to evaluate this and extend previous research (Gentzler \& Kerns, 2006; Gentzler et al., 2010; Sheinbaum et al., 2015). This is important because major positive life events might solidify internal working models of attachment. Additionally, secure attachment and savoring positive emotions correlate with well-being. Participants (N = 310; Mage = 31.26) completed measures of attachment (i.e., attachment-based anxiety and avoidance) and emotions (e.g., joy, stress) in positive life events involving parents. Results of multiple hierarchical regression showed that insecure attachment predicted decreased joy (p {$<$} .001) and increased stress (p {$<$} .001) for positive events, after controlling for gender and age. Similarly, for imagined future events, insecure attachment predicted less positive emotions (p {$<$} .001) and more negative emotions (p {$<$} .001). These results imply that parental attachment can negatively impact positive emotions such as joy during positive life events. Implications and applications are discussed.},

In the present experiments (n = 80 and n = 79), we provided or did not provide participants with the opportunity to recommend a punishment for an in-group or an out-group deviant. We also measured in-group identification before and after exposure to deviant behavior and after judgment. The results show that participants first disidentified from the in-group but, when presented with an opportunity to judge the deviant, also derogated. Importantly, participants who could judge the deviant also recovered their initial in-group identification level. Participants' reactions to the out-group deviant suggest they used an intergroup rather than intragroup strategy.},

Second, our panel and experimental data allow for the most definitive test to date of whether political orientations exert a causal effect on religious and secular orientations.

We show that participants criticized the morality and intellect of someone else who made a Bayesian judgment, shared less money with this person, and incurred financial costs to punish this person. However, participants made unequal judgments as a Bayesian statistician would, thereby rendering the same judgment that they found repugnant when offered by someone else. This inconsistency, which can be reconciled by differences in which base rate is attended to, suggests that participants use group membership in a way that reflects the savvy of a Bayesian and the disrepute of someone they consider to be a bigot.},

  abstract = {The method of loci is arguably the most famous mnemonic strategy and is highly effective for memorising lists of non-spatial information in order. As described and instructed, this strategy apparently relies on a spatial/navigational metaphor. The user imagines moving through an environment, placing (study) and reporting (recall) list items along the way. However, whether the method relies critically on this spatial/navigation metaphor is unknown. An alternative hypothesis is that the navigation component is superfluous to memory success, and the method of loci is better viewed as a special case of a larger class of imagery-based peg strategies. Training participants on three virtual environments varying in their characteristics (an apartment, an open field, and a radial-arm maze), we asked participants to use each trained environment as the basis of the method of loci to learn five 11-word lists. Performance varied significantly across environment. However, the effects were small in magnitude. Further tests suggested that navigation-relevant knowledge and ability were not major determinants of success in verbal memory, even for participants who were confirmed to have been compliant with the strategy. These findings echo neuroimaging findings that navigation-based cognition does occur during application of the method of loci, but imagined navigation is unlikely to be directly responsible for its effectiveness. Instead, the method of loci may be best viewed as a variant of peg methods.},

Scientists and philosophers have long debated this question, but few have considered laypeople's beliefs about altruism. Here, we examine such lay theories surrounding altruism. Across two studies, observers read about agents who behaved prosocially. In some cases, agents benefitted materially, socially, or emotionally from their actions (self-oriented consequences); in other cases, they acted in order to accrue these benefits (self-oriented motives). Observers ``penalized'' actions that produced self-oriented consequences \textendash{} rating them as less altruistic than actions involving no such benefit \textendash{} unless these benefits were emotional. When agents' actions involved self-oriented motives, observers penalized them more harshly, viewing their behavior as more selfish than even clearly non-prosocial acts. These data suggest that lay theories distinguish between motives for, and ``side effects'' of, prosocial actions, converging with recent psychological theories of altruism.},

Here we ask how second language learners of Spanish cope with this subtlety. Recently, native speakers? agreement has been attributed to the way phonotactic and morpholexical properties influence morphological processing. In a lexical decision experiment, we show that while the polarity of learners? responses differed from earlier native speaker results, their response latencies exhibit striking sensitivity to the very same ingredients shown to predict nativelike behavior.},

In four experiments (n = 797), women and men made considerably stronger discrimination attributions, and were moderately more discouraged from seeking work, when the victim was female rather than male. Further, a series of regressions analyses showed beliefs in discrimination of women to be moderately correlated with discrimination attributions of female victims, but little added explanatory value of participant gender, stigma consciousness, or feminist identification.

Properly equipped international organizations, however, can mitigate these dilemmas by analyzing and acting on sensitive information while protecting it from wide dissemination. Using new data on intelligence disclosures to the International Atomic Energy Agency and an analysis of the full universe of nuclear proliferation cases, we demonstrate that strengthening the agency's intelligence protection capabilities led to greater intelligence sharing and fewer suspected nuclear facilities.

  abstract = {Despite the widely ratified United Nations Declaration of Human Rights, support for civil liberties is easily eroded in times of threat. Understanding which factors moderate the relationship between threat and support for civil liberties is critical, yet remains relatively unexplored. In this study, we test a double moderation model in which support for the restriction of civil liberties in the face of threat is moderated by both right-wing authoritarianism and political sophistication. In a national representative dataset (N = 12,507), those low on right-wing authoritarianism became more like their high right-wing authoritarian peers in the face of threat. Also, those more sophisticated about political issues were less supportive of restrictions on civil liberties, but only when threat was low. We tested this model on both restrictions for the in-group, in terms of being wiretapped, and for the out-group, in terms of torturing suspected terrorists. Our results suggest that increasing political sophistication may have desirable consequences when considering the outcomes for in-group members, and we argue for increased efforts to expand the in-group we seek to protect.},

Our measure is an order of magnitude better than the capability ratio at predicting dispute outcomes. We replicate Reed et al. (2008) and find, contrary to the original conclusions, that the probability of conflict is always highest when the state with the least benefits has a preponderance of power. In replications of 18 other dyadic analyses that use power as a control, we find that replacing the standard measure with DOE scores usually improves both in-sample and out-of-sample goodness of fit.},

Methodologists have proposed a variety of statistical approaches to correct for such overestimation. However, it is not clear which methods work best for data typically seen in psychology. Here, we present a comprehensive simulation study in which we examined how some of the most promising meta-analytic methods perform on data that might realistically be produced by research in psychology. We simulated several levels of questionable research practices, publication bias, and heterogeneity, and used study sample sizes empirically derived from the literature. Our results clearly indicated that no single meta-analytic method consistently outperformed all the others. Therefore, we recommend that meta-analysts in psychology focus on sensitivity analyses\textemdash that is, report on a variety of methods, consider the conditions under which these methods fail (as indicated by simulation studies such as ours), and then report how conclusions might change depending on which conditions are most plausible. Moreover, given the dependence of meta-analytic methods on untestable assumptions, we strongly recommend that researchers in psychology continue their efforts to improve the primary literature and conduct large-scale, preregistered replications.

A total of 21 patients with schizophrenia and 21 age-, gender-, and IQ-matched healthy controls completed an interactive computer game with an on-screen avatar that participants believed was controlled by an off-screen partner. On social trials, participants were required to achieve joint attention by correctly interpreting and responding to gaze cues. Participants also completed non-social trials in which they responded to an arrow cue within the same task context. While patients and controls took equivalent time to process communicative intent from gaze shifts, patients made significantly more errors than controls when responding to the directional information conveyed by gaze, but not arrow, cues. Despite no differences in response times to gaze cues between groups, patients were significantly slower than controls when responding to arrow cues. This is the opposite pattern of results previously observed in autistic adults using the same task and suggests that, despite general impairments in attention orienting or oculomotor control, patients with schizophrenia demonstrate a facilitation effect when responding to communicative gaze cues. Findings indicate a hyper-responsivity to gaze cues of communicative intent in schizophrenia. The possible effects of self-referential biases when evaluating gaze direction are discussed, as are clinical implications.},

Four of the five manipulations we tested activated the concept of money, but, contrary to what we expected based on the preponderance of the published literature, no manipulation consistently affected any dependent measure. Moderation by sociodemographic characteristics was sparse and inconsistent across studies.

Using mixed-effects logistic regressions, we reanalyzed 58 parental reports of native-signing deaf children's productive acquisition of 332 signs in American Sign Language (ASL; Anderson \& Reilly, 2002) and found that iconicity, neighborhood density, and lexical frequency independently facilitated vocabulary acquisition. Despite differences in iconicity and phonological structure between signed and spoken language, signing children, like children learning a spoken language, track statistical information about lexical items and their phonological properties and leverage this information to expand their vocabulary.},

On the basis of decades of research, it should be especially effective when people adopt the perspective of individuals who hold alternative views. In the current research, however, we found the opposite: In three preregistered experiments (total N = 2,734), we found that taking the perspective of someone who endorses a counterattitudinal view lowers receptiveness to that view and reduces attitude change following a counterattitudinal-argument-generation task. This ironic effect can be understood through value congruence: Individuals who take the opposition's perspective generate arguments that are incongruent with their own values, which diminishes receptiveness and attitude change. Thus, trying to ``put yourself in their shoes'' can ultimately undermine self-persuasion. Consistent with a value-congruence account, this backfire effect is attenuated when people take the perspective of someone who holds the counterattitudinal view yet has similar overall values.},

While social concepts have been associated to superior anterior temporal lobe (sATL), the neural correlates of quantity-related concepts have seldom been investigated. The right intraparietal sulcus (IPS) is known to be involved in the processing of numerical information and of quantifiers. In the present study, we investigated the causal role of right sATL and right IPS in representing social and quantity-related concepts, using a state-dependent transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-priming paradigm. We modulated the neural activation by priming to a category label (either SOCIAL or QUANTITY), before applying TMS and presenting the target (i.e., an exemplar of one of the two abstract classes). When the target word belonged to the quantity category, TMS applied over the IPS (but not sATL) abolished the expected priming effect by speeding up reaction times (RTs) in incongruent trials. For the social category, both IPS and sATL stimulation abolished the priming effect, by reducing RTs in incongruent trials. Our results suggest a specialization of distinct brain areas in processing different classes of abstract concepts. The right IPS contains neuronal representations tuned to quantity-related concepts, in line with its well-known role in numerical and magnitude representation. Social concepts, in contrast, are represented in both the right sATL and the right IPS, known to be involved in social cognition and person-related knowledge.},

This empirical regularity, known as ``post error slowing'' (PES), has been traditionally interpreted as the result of a conservative response criterion adopted to avoid future errors and it is supposed to be driven by changes in the excitability of the motor system. However, the consequences of errors have been almost exclusively investigated by means of button-press tasks, which have been criticized because of their limited ecological validity and it is still unclear to what extent errors bias the motor system activity during the planning and the on-line control of complex and realistic goal-directed actions. To overcome these potential limitations, in the present study, we investigated the effect of errors on the preparation and execution of the reach-to-grasp movement, one of the most significant daily life actions. In addition to reaction times (RTs), we measured motor-evoked potential (MEP) to explore the influence of errors on corticospinal (CS) excitability, and we applied kinematical analysis to examine the underlying reorganization of the movement following an error. The results of the present study showed that MEPs tend to be reduced after the failure to reach and grasp an object, supporting the traditional interpretation of PES. Furthermore, in addition to RTs, we found that error-reactivity strategically influences the grasping component of the action, whereas the reaching component appears to be impermeable to PES. These findings demonstrate that the error-reactivity is a strong empirical phenomenon, which spreads into the motor system at the level of both movement preparation and execution, even when more realistic and ecologically valid tasks are used.},

This convention ensures that perceptual impairment arising from developmental prosopagnosia can be distinguished from problems arising from a lack of visual experience with particular facial ethnicities \textendash{} the so-called `Other-Ethnicity Effect'. The present study sought to determine whether the perceptual difficulties seen in developmental prosopagnosia \textendash{} diagnosed using same-ethnicity faces \textendash{} extend to other-ethnicity faces. First, we sought to determine whether a group of Caucasian developmental prosopagnosics (N~=~15) and typical Caucasian controls (N~=~30) had similar experience with same- and other-ethnicity faces during development. All participants therefore completed a contact questionnaire that enquired about their experience of Caucasian, Black, and East Asian faces, at different developmental stages. Importantly, the two groups described very similar levels of visual experience with other-ethnicity faces. Second, we administered a sequential matching task to measure participants' ability to discriminate same- (Caucasian) and other-ethnicity (Black, East Asian) faces. Relative to the experience-matched controls, the prosopagnosics were less accurate at discriminating both same- and other-ethnicity faces, and we found no evidence of disproportionate impairment for same-ethnicity faces. Given that the prosopagnosics and controls had similar opportunity to develop visual expertise for other-ethnicity faces, these results indicate that developmental prosopagnosia impairs recognition of both same- and other-ethnicity faces. The fact that developmental prosopagnosia affects the perception of both same- and other-ethnicity faces suggests that different facial ethnicities engage similar visual processing mechanisms. Our findings support the view that susceptibility to developmental prosopagnosia, and a lack of contact with other-ethnicity faces, contribute independently to the poor recognition of other-ethnicity faces.},

We hypothesized that the visual system utilizes perceptual groups characterized by spatial configuration and represents separate ensembles for different groups. Therefore, participants could not integrate ensembles of different perceptual groups on a task basis. We asked participants to determine the average orientation of visual elements comprising a surface with a contour situated inside. Although participants were asked to estimate the average orientation of all the elements, they ignored orientation signals embedded in the contour. This constraint may help the visual system to keep the visual features of occluding objects separate from those of the occluded objects.},

Overall, participants underestimated current mobility and erroneously concluded that mobility has declined over the past four decades.

Persistence was stronger and the debunking effect was weaker when audiences generated reasons in support of the initial misinformation. A detailed debunking message correlated positively with the debunking effect.

Across six studies we demonstrated that White women perceived a Black male expert as less likely than White men to hold negative stereotypes about women's intelligence (Study 1, 2), especially if women were high in stigma solidarity (Study 3, 6), mitigating cognitive interference (Study 2, 4). Further, an outgroup expert who was not similarly stereotyped (i.e., Asian male) did not mitigate these identity threat effects (Study 5, 6). Thus, we contend that White women, especially those high in stigma solidarity, perceive similarly stereotyped outgroup experts as less likely to hold negative stereotypes about their intelligence, buffering against identity threats in such settings. This adds to a growing literature identifying the conditions under which intraminority relations can serve to expand contextual cues that signal identity safety.},

The laboratory-in-the-field experiment is set in Lebanon's capital, Beirut, and involves interactions between 180 Shia and 180 Sunni Muslim participants. We find that the expert appeal increases intersectarian cooperation in settings that do not entail reciprocal exchange. On average, cross-sectarian discussions do not improve cooperation, but those discussions in which participants delve deeply into the conflict's causes and possible remedies are associated with greater cooperation. Neither intervention diminishes the effectiveness of sectarian clientelistic appeals. The policy implication of our study is that intergroup cooperation can be strengthened even in regions as bitterly divided as the Middle East.},

Many of society's most significant social decisions similarly involve the joint evaluation of multiple candidates. Are social decisions subject to the same violations, and if so, what account best characterizes the nature of the violations? Across five studies, we tested whether decision-makers exhibit context-dependent preferences in hiring scenarios and past U.S. congressional race outcomes and compared different models of value coding as sources of the hypothesized context-dependence. Studies 1a, 1b, and 1d revealed that a divisive normalization value coding scheme best characterized participants' choices across a series of hiring decisions, and that participants exhibited context-dependent preferences. However, the distractor had the opposite effect of that predicted by divisive normalization once we accounted for the random effect of participant: as the value of the distractor increased, participants were more likely to hire the highest-valued candidate. In Study 2, we used a combination of archival electoral data and survey data to examine whether normalization models could explain the outcomes of congressional elections. Electoral outcomes were predicted by political candidates' inferred competence, but this time in line with the divisive normalization account. Our findings offer mixed support for a formal, neurobiologically-derived account of when and how specific alternatives exert their effects on social evaluation and choice, and highlight conditions under which high-value distractors increase versus decrease relative choice accuracy.},

In this paper, we reexamined the question of automaticity in social comparison by testing the hypothesis that subliminal social comparison affects explicit self-evaluations. In two high-powered experiments, young women were subliminally exposed (or not) to a high standard of comparison (media images of ultra-thin women). Next, they made explicit self-evaluations of their body appearance anxiety. Using both between-participants (Experiment 1) and within-participant (Experiment 2) designs, we found converging evidence that subliminal exposure to the thin ideal increases body appearance anxiety in women. Using Bayes factors as measures of evidence, the present experiments provided substantial (Experiment 1) and very strong (Experiment 2) evidence that social comparison takes place outside awareness and affects explicit self-evaluations. The present experiments can be easily replicated using a standardized procedure (replication script) that is publicly available on the Open Science Framework. We discuss how these findings contribute to reestablish confidence in the modern view of social comparison as an automatic process.},

Four experiments showed that in certain conditions, participants could not report an attribute (e.g., letter identity) of a stimulus even when that attribute had been attended and had reached a full state of conscious awareness just prior to being questioned about it. We term this effect attribute amnesia, and it occurs when participants repeatedly locate a target using one attribute and are then unexpectedly asked to report that attribute. This discovery suggests that attention to and awareness of a stimulus attribute are insufficient to ensure its immediate reportability. These results imply that when attention is configured by using an attribute for target selection, that attribute will not necessarily be remembered.},

We examined the impact of the causal centrality of a feature, a key determinant of the extent to which a feature defines a concept, on judgments of identity continuity. We found support for this approach in three experiments using both measured and manipulated causal centrality. For judgments both of one's self and of others, we found that some features are perceived to be more causally central than others and that changes in such causally central features are believed to be more disruptive to identity.},

Two studies used less constrained, implicit (Experiment 1) and explicit categorization (Experiment 2) tasks and found that multiracial faces were most frequently categorized into racial minority groups but not necessarily as Black. These studies suggested a minority bias in multiracial categorizations, whereby multiracials are more frequently categorized as non-White than as White. Experiment 3 provided additional support for the minority bias, showing that participants categorized multiracials as ``Not White'' more often than as any other category. Participants were also faster to exclude multiracial faces from the White category than from any other racial category.

  abstract = {Abstract Painful peripheral neuropathy is a severe and difficult-to-treat neurological complication associated with cancer chemotherapy. Although chemotherapeutic drugs such as paclitaxel are known to cause tonic activation of presynaptic NMDA receptors (NMDARs) to potentiate nociceptive input, the molecular mechanism involved in this effect is unclear. {$\alpha$}2{$\delta$}-1, commonly known as a voltage-activated calcium channel subunit, is a newly discovered NMDAR-interacting protein and plays a critical role in NMDAR-mediated synaptic plasticity. Here we show that paclitaxel treatment in rats increases the {$\alpha$}2{$\delta$}-1 expression level in the dorsal root ganglion and spinal cord and the mRNA levels of GluN1, GluN2A, and GluN2B in the spinal cord. Paclitaxel treatment also potentiates the {$\alpha$}2{$\delta$}-1?NMDAR interaction and synaptic trafficking in the spinal cord. Strikingly, inhibiting {$\alpha$}2{$\delta$}-1 trafficking with pregabalin, disrupting the {$\alpha$}2{$\delta$}-1?NMDAR interaction with an {$\alpha$}2{$\delta$}-1 C-terminus?interfering peptide, or {$\alpha$}2{$\delta$}-1 genetic ablation fully reverses paclitaxel treatment-induced presynaptic NMDAR-mediated glutamate release from primary afferent terminals to spinal dorsal horn~neurons. In addition, intrathecal injection of pregabalin or {$\alpha$}2{$\delta$}-1 C-terminus?interfering peptide and {$\alpha$}2{$\delta$}-1 knockout in mice markedly attenuate paclitaxel-induced pain hypersensitivity. Our findings indicate that {$\alpha$}2{$\delta$}-1 is required for paclitaxel-induced tonic activation of presynaptic NMDARs at the spinal cord level. Targeting {$\alpha$}2{$\delta$}-1?bound NMDARs, not the physiological {$\alpha$}2{$\delta$}-1?free NMDARs, may be a new strategy for treating chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain.

By contrast, how grouping influences the allocation of attention over time is much less clear. This study investigated this issue, using an attentional blink (AB) paradigm to test how grouping influences the initial selection and the subsequent short-term memory consolidation of a target. On a given trial, two red Kanizsa-type targets (T1 and T2) with varying grouping strength were embedded in a rapid serial visual presentation stream of irrelevant distractors. Our results showed the typical AB finding: impaired identification of T2 when presented close in time following T1. Moreover, the AB was modulated by the T2 grouping\textemdash independently of the T1 structure\textemdash with stronger grouping leading to a decreased AB and overall higher performance. Conversely, a reversed pattern, namely an increased AB with increasing grouping strength was observed when the Kanizsa figure was not task-relevant. Together, these findings suggest that the grouping benefit emerges at early perceptual stages, automatically drawing attentional resources, thereby leading to either sustained benefits or transient costs\textemdash depending on the task-relevance of the grouped object. This indicates that grouping modulates processing of objects in time.},

  abstract = {To determine the role of reduced dopaminergic transmission for declines of forced versus spontaneous behavior, we used a model of Parkinson's disease with progressive degeneration of dopamine (DA) neurons, the MitoPark mouse. Mice were subjected to rotarod tests of motor coordination, and open field and cylinder tests for spontaneous locomotor activity and postural axial support. To measure DA release in dorsal striatum and the shell of Nucleus Accumbens (NAc), we used ex vivo fast-scan cyclic voltammetry in 6- to 24-week-old mice. To determine decline of DA transporter function, we used 18FE-PE2I positron emission tomography. We show here that fast-scan cyclic voltammetry is a sensitive tool to detect evoked DA release dysfunction in MitoPark mice and that electrically evoked DA release is affected earlier in nigrostriatal than mesolimbic DA systems. DA reuptake was also affected more slowly in NAc shell. Positron emission tomography data showed DA uptake to be barely above detection levels in 16- and 20-week-old MitoPark mice. Rotarod performance was not impaired until mice were 16 weeks old, when evoked DA release in striatum had decreased to {$\approx$} 40\% of wild-type levels. In contrast, impairment of open field locomotion and rearing began at 10 weeks, in parallel with the initial modest decline of evoked DA release. We conclude that forced behaviors, such as motivation not to fall, can be partially maintained even when DA release is severely compromised, whereas spontaneous behaviors are much more sensitive to impaired DA release, and that presumed secondary non-dopaminergic system alterations do not markedly counteract or aggravate effects of severe impairment of DA release.

Subjects adapted to randomly oriented moving lines that straddled the vertical meridian; these lines were vertically offset between the left and right hemifields. Subsequent vernier alignment judgments revealed a negative aftereffect: An offset in the same direction as the adaptation was required to correct the perceived misalignment. This aftereffect was specific to adaptation to vertical, but not horizontal, misalignments and also occurred following adaptation to movie clips and patterns without coherent motion. Our results demonstrate that the visual system unifies the left and right halves of visual space by continuously recalibrating the alignment of elements across the visual fields.},

Connectivity-based MRI measures have emerged as a way to study how recovery from brain injury is modulated by changes in intra- and inter-hemispheric connectivity. Here we report a detailed and multi-modal case study of a 26 year-old male who presented with a left inferior parietal glioma infiltrating the left arcuate fasciculus. The patient underwent pre- and post-operative functional MRI and Diffusion Tensor Imaging, as well as behavioral assessments of language, motor, vision and praxis. The surgery for removal of the tumor was carried out with the patient awake, and direct electrical stimulation mapping was used to evaluate cortical language centers. The patient developed a specific difficulty with repeating sentences toward the end of the surgery, after resection of the tumor and partial transection of the arcuate fasciculus. The patient recovered from the sentence repetition impairments over several months after the operation. Coincident with the patient's cognitive recovery, we document a pattern whereby intra-hemispheric functional connectivity was reduced in the left hemisphere, while inter-hemispheric connectivity increased between classic left hemisphere language regions and their right hemisphere homologues. These findings suggest that increased synchrony between the two hemispheres, in the setting of focal transection of the left arcuate fasciculus, can facilitate functional recovery.},

Across five experiments (N = 330), we showed that children between 4 and 8 years of age engaged in negative direct reciprocity but generalized positive reciprocity, despite recalling benefactors. Children did not endorse the norm of positive direct reciprocity as applying to them until about 7 years of age (Study 4), but a short social-norm training enhanced this behavior in younger children (Study 5). Results suggest that negative direct reciprocity develops early, whereas positive reciprocity becomes targeted to other specific individuals only as children learn and adopt social norms.},

Participants looked for an oddly colored diamond among diamonds with colors taken from either uniform or Gaussian color distributions. On test trials, the targets had various distances in feature space from the mean of the preceding distractor color distribution. Targets on test trials therefore served as probes into probabilistic representations of distractor colors. Test-trial response times revealed a striking similarity between the physical distribution of colors and their internal representations. The results demonstrate that the visual system represents color ensembles in a more detailed way than previously thought, coding not only mean and variance but, most surprisingly, the actual shape (uniform or Gaussian) of the distribution of colors in the environment.},

This assumption is that multimodal integration requires consciousness; however, few studies have explicitly tested if integration can occur between nonconscious information from different modalities. The proposed study examined whether a classic indicator of multimodal integration \textendash{} the McGurk effect \textendash{} can be elicited with subliminal auditory\textendash visual speech stimuli. We used a masked speech priming paradigm developed by Kouider and Dupoux (2005) in conjunction with continuous flash suppression (CFS; Tsuchiya \& Koch, 2005), a binocular rivalry technique for presenting video stimuli subliminally. Applying these techniques together, we carried out two experiments in which participants categorised auditory syllable targets which were preceded by subliminal auditory\textendash visual (AV) speech primes. Subliminal AV primes were either illusion-inducing (McGurk) or illusion-neutral (Incongruent) combinations of speech stimuli. In Experiment 1, the categorisation of the syllable target (``pa'') was facilitated by the same syllable prime when it was part of a McGurk combination (auditory ``pa'' and visual ``ka'') but not when part of an Incongruent combination (auditory ``pa'' and visual ``wa''). This dependency on specific AV combinations indicated a nonconscious AV interaction. Experiment 2 presented a different syllable target (``ta'') which matched the predicted illusory outcome of the McGurk combination \textendash{} here, both the McGurk combination (auditory ``pa'' and visual ``ka'') and the Incongruent combination (auditory ``ta'' and visual ``ka'') failed to facilitate target categorisation. The combined results of both Experiments demonstrate a type of nonconscious multimodal interaction that is distinct from integration \textendash{} it allows unimodal information that is compatible for integration (i.e., McGurk combinations) to persist and influence later processes, but does not actually combine and alter that information. As the GWS model does not account for non-integrative multimodal interactions, this places some pressure on such models of consciousness.},

  abstract = {Acting adequately in a given situation is complicated by the presence of ambiguous information. Being able to overcome such conflicts is a necessary prerequisite in everyday life, because it enables goal-directed behavior. On a conceptual level, different kinds of conflict can be distinguished: conflicts at a stimulus level (S-S conflicts) can be dissociated from stimulus-response (S-R) conflicts. Considering cognitive psychological frameworks, we examined whether simultaneously presented conflicts potentiate each other, or are rather integrated into a single conflict. To assess the neurophysiological mechanisms and functional neuroanatomical structures that are modulated by independent, interfering or integrative processing of conflicts, we use a Simon-Stroop paradigm in combination with EEG recordings and source localization. We show that S-R (Simon) conflict monitoring processes reflected by anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and N2 ERP component modulations are unaffected by simultaneous S-S (Stroop) conflicts. In contrast to that, S-S (Stroop) conflicts, reflected in N450 ERP component and ACC modulations are not processed separately when there is an already existing S-R conflict. Rather, S-S (Stroop) conflicts are likely integrated into previously established S-R conflict resolution and also modulate response selection processes associated with the modulation of the P3 ERP component and dorsolateral prefrontal structures. The results suggest that even though different kinds of conflicts can be distinguished, they can become integrated during neural processing associated with medial frontal areas.},

  abstract = {Abstract Approximately 70 lysosomal storage diseases are currently known, resulting from mutations in genes encoding lysosomal enzymes and membrane proteins. Defects in lysosomal enzymes that hydrolyze sphingolipids have been relatively well studied. Gaucher disease is caused by the loss of activity of glucocerebrosidase, leading to accumulation of glucosylceramide. Gaucher disease exhibits a number of subtypes, with types 2 and 3 showing significant neuropathology. Sandhoff disease results from the defective activity of ?-hexosaminidase, leading to accumulation of ganglioside GM2. Niemann-Pick type C disease is primarily caused by the loss of activity of the lysosomal membrane protein, NPC1, leading to storage of cholesterol and sphingosine. All three disorders display significant neuropathology, accompanied by neuroinflammation. It is commonly assumed that neuroinflammation is the result of infiltration of monocyte-derived macrophages into the brain; for instance, cells resembling lipid-engorged macrophages (?Gaucher cells?) have been observed in the brain of Gaucher disease patients. We now review the evidence that inflammatory macrophages are recruited into the brain in these diseases and then go on to provide some experimental data that, at least in the three mouse models tested, monocyte-derived macrophages do not appear to infiltrate the brain. Resident microglia, which are phenotypically distinct from infiltrating macrophages, are the only myeloid population present in significant numbers within the brain parenchyma in these authentic mouse models, even during the late symptomatic stages of disease when there is substantial neuroinflammation.

In the present study, we aimed to replicate these findings in an eye-tracking experiment with better controlled materials and increased statistical power. Crucially, we found clear evidence for active gap-filling across all levels of dependency length. This diverges from Wagers and Phillips's findings but is in line with the long-standing generalisation that comprehenders build and interpret filler-gap dependencies predictively as long as they are grammatically licensed. We found that the effect became smaller in the long dependency conditions in the post-critical region, which suggests the weaker effect in the long dependency conditions may have been undetected in Wagers and Phillips's study due to insufficient statistical power and/or the use of a self-paced reading paradigm.},

A sample of 516 adults completed measures of openness to experience (from the NEO Five-Factor Inventory-3 and Big Five Aspect Scales) and a semantic verbal fluency task. Next, the sample was split into half to form high (n = 258) and low (n = 258) openness to experience groups. Semantic networks were then constructed on the basis of their verbal fluency responses. Our results revealed that the high openness to experience group's network was more interconnected, flexible, and had better local organization of associations than the low openness to experience group. We also found that the high openness to experience group generated more responses on average and provided more unique responses than the low openness to experience group.

  abstract = {Abstract Previous research has obtained mixed findings as to whether feelings of self?worth are positively or negatively related to right?wing ideological beliefs and prejudice. We propose to clarify the link between self?worth and ideology by distinguishing between narcissistic and non?narcissistic self?evaluations as well as between different dimensions of ideological attitudes. Four studies, conducted in three different socio?political contexts: the UK (Study 1, N~=~422), the US (Studies 2 and 3, Ns~=~471 and 289, respectively), and Poland (Study 4, N~=~775), investigated the associations between narcissistic and non?narcissistic self?evaluations, social dominance orientation (SDO), right?wing authoritarianism (RWA), and ethnic prejudice. Confirming our hypotheses, the results consistently showed that after controlling for self?esteem, narcissistic self?evaluation was positively associated with SDO (accounting for RWA), yet negatively associated with RWA (accounting for SDO). These associations were similar after controlling for psychopathy and Machiavellianism (Study 3) as well as collective narcissism and Big Five personality characteristics (Study 4). Studies 2?4 additionally demonstrated that narcissistic self?evaluation was indirectly positively associated with prejudice through higher SDO (free of RWA) but indirectly negatively associated with prejudice through lower RWA (free of SDO). Implications for understanding the role of self?evaluation in right?wing ideological attitudes and prejudice are discussed. Copyright ? 2017 The Authors.

  abstract = {It is widely believed that democracy requires public support to survive. The empirical evidence for this hypothesis is weak, however, with existing tests resting on small cross-sectional samples and producing contradictory results. The underlying problem is that survey measures of support for democracy are fragmented across time, space, and different survey questions. In response, this article uses a Bayesian latent variable model to estimate a smooth country-year panel of democratic support for 135 countries and up to 29 years. The article then demonstrates a positive effect of support on subsequent democratic change, while adjusting for the possible confounding effects of prior levels of democracy and unobservable time-invariant factors. Support is, moreover, more robustly linked with the endurance of democracy than its emergence in the first place. As Lipset (1959) and Easton (1965) hypothesized over 50 years ago, public support does indeed help democracy survive.},

As difficulty increases beyond the point at which people can perform both tasks accurately, they should switch strategy and focus on one task at the expense of the other. Across three very different tasks (target detection, throwing, and memory), none of the participants switched their strategy at the correct point. Moreover, the majority consistently failed to modify their strategy in response to changes in task difficulty. This failure may have been related to uncertainty about their own ability, because in a version of the experiment in which there was no uncertainty, participants uniformly switched at an optimal point.},

And do women and men respond to women's presence similarly? Though scholars have demonstrated the substantive and symbolic benefits of women's representation, little work has examined how women's presence affects citizens' perceptions of democratic legitimacy. We test the relationship between representation and legitimacy beliefs through survey experiments on a nationally representative sample of U.S. citizens. First, we find that women's equal presence legitimizes decisions that go against women's interests. We show suggestive evidence that this effect is particularly pronounced among men, who tend to hold less certain views on women's rights. Second, across decision outcomes and issue areas, women's equal presence legitimizes decision-making processes and confers institutional trust and acquiescence. These findings add new theoretical insights into how, when, and for whom inclusive representation increases perceptions of democratic legitimacy.},

  abstract = {The mammalian order primates contains wide species diversity. Members of the subfamily Colobinae are unique amongst extant primates in that their gastrointestinal systems more closely resemble those of ruminants than other members of the primate order. In the growing literature surrounding nonhuman primate microbiomes, analysis of microbial communities has been limited to the hindgut, since few studies have captured data on other gut sites, including the foregut of colobine primates. In this study, we used the red-shanked douc (Pygathrix nemaeus) as a model for colobine primates to study the relationship between gastrointestinal bacterial community structure and gut site within and between subjects. We analyzed fecal and pregastric stomach content samples, representative of the hindgut and foregut respectively, using 16S recombinant DNA (rDNA) sequencing and identified microbiota using closed-reference operational taxonomic unit (OTU) picking against the GreenGenes database. Our results show divergent bacterial communities clearly distinguish the foregut and hindgut microbiomes. We found higher bacterial biodiversity and a higher Firmicutes:Bacteroides ratio in the hindgut as opposed to the foregut. These gut sites showed strong associations with bacterial function. Specifically, energy metabolism was upregulated in the hindgut, whereas detoxification was increased in the foregut. Our results suggest a red-shanked douc's foregut microbiome is no more concordant with its own hindgut than it is with any other red-shanked douc's hindgut microbiome, thus reinforcing the notion that the bacterial communities of the foregut and hindgut are distinctly unique.

Despite recent scientific advances, a remaining puzzle is the purported association between d\'ej\`a vu and feelings of premonition. Building on research showing that d\'ej\`a vu can be driven by an unrecalled memory of a past experience that relates to the current situation, we sought evidence of memory-based predictive ability during d\'ej\`a vu states. D\'ej\`a vu did not lead to above-chance ability to predict the next turn in a navigational path resembling a previously experienced but unrecalled path (although such resemblance increased reports of d\'ej\`a vu). However, d\'ej\`a vu states were accompanied by increased feelings of knowing the direction of the next turn. The results suggest that feelings of premonition during d\'ej\`a vu occur and can be illusory. Metacognitive bias brought on by the state itself may explain the peculiar association between d\'ej\`a vu and the feeling of premonition.},

Yet, existing research has largely overlooked the influence of disgust, which is a basic emotion that leads people to avoid contamination threats. We illustrate how disgust may impede learning, as compared to the more commonly studied emotion of anxiety. Disgust and anxiety are natural reactions to many kinds of political threats, but the two emotions influence political engagement in different ways. This study investigated the distinctive effects of disgust in a series of experiments that manipulated information about the outbreak of an infectious disease. People who felt disgusted by a health threat were less likely to learn crucial facts about the threat and less likely to seek additional information. Thus, disgust has the counterintuitive effect of decreasing public engagement in precisely those situations where it is most critical.},

Perceived support was assessed by questionnaire, and daily interpersonal conflict and receipt of hugs were assessed by telephone interviews on 14 consecutive evenings. Subsequently, participants were exposed to a virus that causes a common cold and were monitored in quarantine to assess infection and illness signs. Perceived support protected against the rise in infection risk associated with increasing frequency of conflict. A similar stress-buffering effect emerged for hugging, which explained 32\% of the attenuating effect of support. Among infected participants, greater perceived support and more-frequent hugs each predicted less-severe illness signs. These data suggest that hugging may effectively convey social support.},

Study 1 demonstrated that allocation to individuals is more efficient than allocation to groups.

Specifically, when beneficiaries were presented as one group, policymakers tended to allocate resources efficiently, maximizing total benefit. However, when beneficiaries were divided into two arbitrary groups (by hospital name), policymakers divided resources more equally across the groups, sacrificing efficiency. Study 3 replicated this effect using a redundant attribute (prognosis) to create groups and found evidence for a mediator of the grouping effect\textemdash the use of individualizing information to rationalize a more equitable allocation decision.},

In a single experiment (N = 8,925), we compared three fair-lineup techniques used by the police with unfair lineups in which we did nothing to prevent distinctive suspects from standing out. Compared with the fair lineups, doing nothing not only increased subjects' willingness to identify the suspect but also markedly impaired subjects' ability to distinguish between innocent and guilty suspects. Accuracy was also reduced at every level of confidence. These results advance theory on witnesses' identification performance and have important practical implications for how police should construct lineups when suspects have distinctive features.},

  abstract = {Individual differences in prosocial behaviour are well-documented. Increasingly, there has been a focus on the specific situations in which particular personality traits predict prosocial behaviour. HEXACO Honesty-Humility\textemdash the basic trait most consistently linked to prosocial behaviour in prior studies\textemdash has been found to predict prosociality most strongly in situations that afford the exploitation of others. Importantly, though, it may be the subjectively perceived situation that affords the behavioural expression of a trait. Following this reasoning, we tested the proposition that Honesty-Humility would predict prosocial behaviour more strongly in situations characterised by, and perceived to contain, two dimensions of interdependence that can afford exploitation: high conflict and high power. However, across a series of incentivised economic games and two large experience sampling studies, we only found inconsistent evidence for the association between Honesty-Humility and prosocial behaviour. Furthermore, the link between Honesty-Humility and prosociality was neither conditional on objective interdependence nor on subjective perceptions of interdependence. Nonetheless, perceptions of conflict and power tracked objective properties of economic games and were related to prosocial behaviour in the lab and field. Future research should take individuals' subjective understanding of situations into account, which may also help understand the (generalisability of the) effect of Honesty-Humility on prosocial behaviour. \textcopyright{} 2019 The Authors.

This concurrent retrieval typically enhances memory for mentioned information (the rehearsal effect) and impairs memory for unmentioned but related information (socially shared retrieval-induced forgetting, SSRIF), relative to memory for unmentioned and unrelated information. Building on research showing that anxiety leads to increased attention to threat-relevant information, we explored whether concurrent retrieval is facilitated in high-anxiety real-world contexts. Participants first learned category-exemplar facts about meningococcal disease. Following a manipulation of perceived risk of infection (low vs. high risk), they listened to a mock radio show in which some of the facts were selectively practiced. Final recall tests showed that the rehearsal effect was equivalent between the two risk conditions, but SSRIF was significantly larger in the high-risk than in the low-risk condition. Thus, the tendency to exaggerate consequences of news events was found to have deleterious consequences.},

Native English speakers were exposed to an artificial language containing four linguistic cues (verb agreement, case marking, animacy, word order), with morphological cues either unmarked, marked in the same color, or marked in different colors. Cue validity (how often a cue was present and correct) and dominance were also manipulated. In Experiment 1, where the morphological cues were low in validity but highly dominant, VIE helped participants to acquire and strengthen one morphological cue (case marking) but not the other (verb agreement). In Experiment 2, where animacy was highly dominant, there was no benefit of VIE; indeed, the same color VIE condition impeded the acquisition of the marked cues. Thus, VIE may only be beneficial in certain circumstances and this may depend on the type of cue as well as its validity and dominance.},

Unlike English and Mandarin, Korean does not have lexical stress. Participants completed a visual-world eye-tracking experiment that examined whether listeners? word recognition is constrained by suprasegmental cues to stress alone or by a combination of segmental and suprasegmental cues. Results showed that English listeners used both suprasegmental cues alone and segmental and suprasegmental cues together to recognize English words, with the effect of stress being greater for combined cues. Conversely, Mandarin listeners used stress in lexical access only when stress was signaled by suprasegmental cues alone, and Korean listeners did so only when stress was signaled by segmental and suprasegmental cues together. These results highlight the importance of a cue-based approach to the study of stress in word recognition. Open Practices This article has been awarded an Open Materials badge.

However, the effect was small, with income inequality accounting for 0.4\% to 0.7\% of within-state variation in racial bias, and was also contingent on model specification, with results dependent on the measure of income inequality used. We found no conclusive evidence linking income inequality to implicit racial bias or racially offensive Google searches. Overall, our findings admit multiple interpretations, but we discuss why statistically small effects of income inequality on explicit racial bias may nonetheless be socially meaningful.},

In many cases, reports are used to create event-level data sets by aggregating information from multiple, and often conflicting, reports to single event observations. We argue that this pre-aggregation is less innocuous than it seems, costing applied researchers opportunities for improved inference. First, researchers cannot evaluate the consequences of different methods of report aggregation. Second, aggregation discards report-level information (i.e., variation across reports) that is useful in addressing measurement error inherent in event data. Therefore, we advocate that data should be supplied and analyzed at the report level. We demonstrate the consequences of using aggregated event data as a predictor or outcome variable, and how analysis can be improved using report-level information directly. These gains are demonstrated with simulated-data experiments and in the analysis of real-world data, using the newly available Mass Mobilization in Autocracies Database (MMAD).},

However, it remains unclear how qualitative information, such as low-level visual salience, is reconstructed and how the precision and bias of this information relate to subjective memory vividness. Here, we tested whether remembered visual salience contributes to vivid recollection. In three experiments, participants studied emotionally negative and neutral images that varied in luminance and color saturation, and they reconstructed the visual salience of each image in a subsequent test. Results revealed, unexpectedly, that memories were recollected as less visually salient than they were encoded, demonstrating a novel memory-fading effect, whereas negative emotion increased subjective memory vividness and the precision with which visual features were encoded. Finally, memory vividness tracked both the precision and remembered salience (bias) of visual information. These findings provide evidence that low-level visual information fades in memory and contributes to the experience of vivid recollection.},

But what are the principle's origins, and how did it become such a fixture? Three studies investigated intuitions about linear order in the Yupno, members of a culture of Papua New Guinea that lacks conventional representations involving ordered lines, and in U.S. undergraduates. Presented with cards representing differing sizes and numerosities, both groups arranged them using linear order or sometimes spatial grouping, a competing principle. But whereas the U.S. participants produced ordered lines in all tasks, strongly favoring a left-to-right format, the Yupno produced them less consistently, and with variable orientations. Conventional linear representations are thus not necessary to spark the intuition of linear order\textemdash which may have other experiential sources\textemdash but they nonetheless regiment when and how the principle is used.},

Using a wisdom-of-crowds approach that capitalizes on the visual system's ability to efficiently combine information, we demonstrated how averaging two noninteracting individuals' continuous estimates of whether a briefly presented image contained a prespecified target can significantly boost detection across a range of tasks. Furthermore, we showed how pairing individuals' estimates to maximize decorrelated patterns of performance in one task can optimize performance on a separate task. These results make significant advances toward combating severe deficits in target detection using straightforward applications for maximizing performance within limited pools of observers.},

This similarity suggests that grouping and averaging are part of a broader set of strategies allowing the visual system to circumvent capacity limitations. To examine how gestalt grouping affects the manner in which information is averaged and remembered, I compared the error in observers' adjustments of remembered sizes of individual circles in two different mean-size sets defined by similarity, proximity, connectedness, or a common region. Overall, errors were more similar within the same gestalt-defined groups than between different gestalt-defined groups, such that the remembered sizes of individual circles were biased toward the mean size of their respective gestalt-defined groups. These results imply that gestalt grouping facilitates perceptual averaging to minimize the error with which individual items are encoded, thereby optimizing the efficiency of visual short-term memory.},

Weather variables consist of temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, solar radiation, and precipitation disaggregated to an hourly time-step. The only hydrometric variable included in the dataset is stream discharge in a daily time-step. Water chemistry data consisted of total nitrogen (TN), total dissolved nitrogen (TDN), total phosphorus (TP), and total dissolved phosphorus (TDP). Samples were collected weekly during the open water season at the same site as the hydrometric gauging station from August 2009 to October 2012 with some gaps (i.e. Fall 2011, Spring 2012, September 2012). In 2013 the sampling frequency was increased to daily or sub-daily during high stream discharge and weekly during low stream discharge. A data overview indicates values within ranges reported for the area. Mean annual, winter, and summer temperatures were 3.5, -10.7, and 17.2\textdegree C, respectively. Annual relative humidity averaged 73.1\% but was higher and more homogenous in cold seasons. Wind speed was similar over the year with annual average of 4.3 m/s. Solar radiation followed the typical curve reported for western Canada, with peak daily average values around 250 W/m2 in July. Precipitation records were mostly comprised of dry hours with 75.3\% of the events being equal or less than 2 mm/h. Stream discharge was typical of the Canadian Prairies; the average peak discharge over the entire period was larger in April (2.3 m3/s) due to large amounts of snowmelt runoff. Average concentrations of TN, TDN, TP, and TDP of 1.54, 1.35, 0.56, and 0.49 mg/L, respectively, were in agreement with values found in previous studies at the site.

Across three studies, when participants in a Dictator Game believed their religious identity was known to their partner, atheists behaved impartially toward ingroup and outgroup partners, whereas Christians consistently demonstrated an ingroup bias. The effects of religious identity on allocations to the outgroup were partially mediated by concerns about being perceived negatively by others and were eliminated by telling participants that their religious identity would be kept anonymous.},

  abstract = {Disruptive behavior is associated with societally and personally problematic levels of aggression and has been linked to abnormal structure and function of fronto-amygdala-striatal regions. Abnormal glutamatergic signalling within this network may play a role in aggression. However, disruptive behavior does not represent a homogeneous construct, but can be fractionated across several dimensions. Of particular interest, callous-unemotional (CU) traits have been shown to modulate the severity, neural and behavioural characterisation, and therapeutic outcomes of disruptive behaviour disorders (DBDs) and aggression. Further, individuals showing disruptive behavior differ to the extent that they engage in subtypes of aggression (i.e., proactive [PA] and reactive aggression [RA]) which may also represent distinct therapeutic targets. Here we investigated how glutamate signalling within the fronto-amygdala-striatal circuitry was altered along these dimensions in youths showing disruptive behavior (n~=~140) and typically developing controls (TD, n~=~93) within the age-range of 8\textendash 18 years. We used proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), striatum, amygdala and insula and associated glutamate concentrations with continuous measures of aggression and CU-traits using linear mixed-effects models. We found evidence of a dissociation for the different measures and glutamate concentrations. CU traits were associated with increased ACC glutamate (`callousness': b~=~.19, t (108)~=~2.63, p~=~.01, r~=~.25; `uncaring': b~=~.18, t (108)~=~2.59, p~=~.011, r~=~.24) while PA was associated with decreased striatal glutamate concentration (b~=~-.23, t (28)~=~-3.02, p~=~.005, r~=~.50). These findings suggest dissociable correlates of CU traits and PA in DBDs, and indicate that the ACC and striatal glutamate may represent novel pharmacological targets in treating these different aspects.},

  abstract = {The beard is arguably one of the most obvious signals of masculinity in humans. Almost 150 years ago, Darwin suggested that beards evolved to communicate formidability to other males, but no studies have investigated whether beards enhance recognition of threatening expressions, such as anger. We found that the presence of a beard increased the speed and accuracy with which participants recognized displays of anger but not happiness (Experiment 1, N = 219). This effect was not due to negative evaluations shared by beardedness and anger or to negative stereotypes associated with beardedness, as beards did not facilitate recognition of another negative expression, sadness (Experiment 2, N = 90), and beards increased the rated prosociality of happy faces in addition to the rated masculinity and aggressiveness of angry faces (Experiment 3, N = 445). A computer-based emotion classifier reproduced the influence of beards on emotion recognition (Experiment 4). The results suggest that beards may alter perceived facial structure, facilitating rapid judgments of anger in ways that conform to evolutionary theory.},

As hypothesized, the squeeze measure detected increases in urge during cue exposure, correlated with verbal urge, and predicted subsequent smoking motivation as indexed by smoking latency. Order effects were not observed, indicating that the squeeze measure was predictive of smoking motivation regardless of whether it was administered before or after a verbal urge measure. Squeeze measures may be viable additions to the measurement toolkit for assessing urge and other visceral states.},

Contrary to intuition, increases in a country's audience costs encourage it to initiate disputes in equilibrium because the costs serve as a commitment device during the subsequent crisis, incentivizing the country to stand firm and coercing its opponent to back down. Nonetheless, the results demonstrate that larger audience costs would result in more peace worldwide, as they also discourage potential opponents from initiating disputes. Beyond regime type, we find that a free press, provisions for executive appointment or removal, and historical rivalries are also important determinants of audience costs.},

These effects were specific to inspiration (instead of adjacent affective experiences) and a belief in God (instead of other empirically unverifiable claims). Being inspired by someone or something (but not inspired to do something) offers a spiritually transcendent experience that elevates belief in God, in part because it makes people feel connected to something beyond themselves.},

Because an agent's state of mind is not directly observable, people typically engage in mindreading\textemdash attempts at inferring mental states\textemdash when forming moral evaluations. The present paper identifies a general target of such mental state inference, mental occurrents\textemdash a catchall term for the thoughts, beliefs, principles, feelings, concerns, and rules accessible in an agent's mind when confronting a morally relevant decision. Moral mental occurrents are those that can provide a moral justification for a particular course of action. Whereas previous mindreading research has examined how people reason back to make sense of an agent's behavior, we instead ask how inferred moral mental occurrents (MOs) constrain moral evaluations for an agent's subsequent actions. Our studies distinguish three accounts of how inferred MOs influence moral evaluations, show that people rely on inferred MOs spontaneously (instead of merely when experimental measures draw attention to them), and identify non-moral contextual cues (e.g., whether the situation demands a quick decision) that guide inferences about MOs. Implications for theory of mind, moral psychology, and social cognition are discussed.},

  abstract = {The process of locomotion is controlled by fine-tuned dopaminergic neurons in the Substantia Nigra pars-compacta (SNpc) that projects their axons to the dorsal striatum regulating cortical innervations of medium spiny neurons. Dysfunction in dopaminergic neurotransmission within the striatum leads to movement impairments, gaiting defects, and hypo-locomotion. Due to their high polarity and extreme axonal arborization, neurons depend on molecular motor proteins and microtubule-based transport for their normal function. Transport defects have been associated with neurodegeneration since axonopathies, axonal clogging, microtubule destabilization, and lower motor proteins levels were described in the brain of patients with Parkinson's Disease and other neurodegenerative disorders. However, the contribution of specific motor proteins to the regulation of the nigrostriatal network remains unclear. Here, we generated different conditional knockout mice for the kinesin heavy chain 5B subunit (Kif5b) of Kinesin-1 to unravel its contribution to locomotion. Interestingly, mice with neuronal Kif5b deletion showed hypo-locomotion, movement initiation deficits, and coordination impairments. High pressure liquid chromatography determined that dopamine (DA) metabolism is impaired in neuronal Kif5b-KO, while no dopaminergic cell loss was observed. However, the deletion of Kif5b only in dopaminergic neurons is not sufficient to induce locomotor defects. Noteworthy, pharmacological stimulation of DA release together with agonist or antagonist of DA receptors revealed selective D2-dependent movement initiation defects in neuronal Kif5b-KO. Finally, subcellular fractionation from striatum showed that Kif5b deletion reduced the amount of dopamine D2 receptor in synaptic plasma membranes. Together, these results revealed an important role for Kif5b in the modulation of the striatal network that is relevant to the overall locomotor response.

  abstract = {Consolidated memories may return to labile/unstable states after their reactivation, thus requiring a restabilization process that is known as reconsolidation. During this time-limited reconsolidation window, reactivated existing memories can be strengthened, weakened or updated with new information. Previous studies have shown that non-invasive stimulation of the lateral prefrontal cortex after memory reactivation strengthened existing verbal episodic memories through reconsolidation, an effect documented by enhanced delayed memory recall (24~h post-reactivation). However, it remains unknown whether the left posterior parietal cortex (PPC), a region involved during reactivation of existing episodic memories, contributes to reconsolidation. To address this question, in this double-blind experiment healthy participants (n~=~27) received transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) with the anode over the left PPC after reactivation of previously learned verbal episodic memories. Memory recall was tested 24~h later. To rule out unspecific effects of memory reactivation or tDCS alone, we included two control groups: one that receives tDCS with the anode over the left PPC without reactivation (n~=~27) and another one that receives tDCS with the anode over a control site (primary visual cortex) after reactivation (n~=~27). We hypothesized that tDCS with the anode over the left PPC after memory reactivation would enhance delayed recall through reconsolidation relative to the two control groups. No significant between groups differences in the mean number of words recalled on day 3 occurred, suggesting no beneficial effect of tDCS over the left PPC. Alternative explanations were discussed, including efficacy of tDCS, different stimulation parameters, electrode montage, and stimulation site within the PPC.},

Research shows Asian second language (L2) learners of English struggle to produce bridging reference appropriately, yet little research has been done on the L2 production of bridging in Asian languages. We collected oral picture sequence narrative data from 80 lower-intermediate L2 Mandarin learners from first language (L1) English (+ article, n = 23) and L1 Korean and Japanese (- article, n = 57) backgrounds, alongside equivalent L1 data. Speakers of article-L1s were more likely than those from article-less L1s to use numeral + classifier noun phrases (NPs) for nonbridging referents and demonstrative + classifier NPs when introducing bridging referents, essentially (and infelicitously) using these constructions as de facto English-like indefinite/definite articles in their L2 Mandarin production. Speakers of article-less languages infelicitously marked bridging relations with nonbridging forms. These findings confirm substantial crosslinguistic difficulties for the L2 marking of this complex syntax-pragmatic phenomenon across relatively underexplored L1/L2 pairs.},

  abstract = {Parkinson's disease (PD) is a disabling and highly costly neurodegenerative condition with worldwide prevalence. Despite advances in treatments that slow progression and minimize locomotor impairments, its clinical management is still a challenge. Previous preclinical studies, using mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) transplantation and isolated physical exercise (EX), reported beneficial results for treatment of PD. Therefore, this experimental randomized study aimed to elucidate the therapeutic potential of combined therapy using adipose-derived human MSCs (ADSCs) grafted into the striatum in conjunction with aerobic treadmill training, specifically in terms of locomotor performance in a unilateral PD rat model induced by 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). Forty-one male Wistar rats were categorized into five groups in accordance with the type of treatment to which they were subjected (Sham, 6-OHDA - injury, 6-OHDA + exercise, 6-OHDA + cells, and 6-OHDA + combined). Subsequently, dopaminergic depletion was assessed by the methylphenidate challenge and the specified therapeutic intervention was conducted in each group. The foot fault task was performed at the end of the experiment to serve as an assessment of motor skills. The results showed that despite disturbances in motor balance and coordination, locomotor dysfunction was ameliorated in all treatment categories in comparison to the injury group (sign test, p {$<$} 0.001, effect size: 0.71). The exercise alone and combined groups were the categories that exhibited the best recovery in terms of movement performance (p {$<$} 0.001). Overall, this study confirms that exercise is a powerful option to improve motor function and a promising adjuvant intervention for stem cell transplantation in the treatment of PD motor symptoms.

In Study 2, participants (N = 100) were randomly assigned to perceive they were engaging in high-risk versus low-risk eating behavior with a friend. They then reported feelings of interpersonal closeness as well as chose how close to sit to their friend. Individuals who were randomly assigned to perceive they were engaging in high-risk eating behavior with a friend reported increased feelings of interpersonal closeness. Also, restrained eaters in the high-risk eating behavior condition reported greater feelings of interpersonal closeness while eating, which was mediated by increased feelings of activated positive affect (e.g., excited, alert). No effect on how close participants sat to their friend was observed. Overall, the current research highlights a previously unstudied pathway from risky eating to excitement to feelings of interpersonal closeness. This provides insight into one psychosocial process that may undermine personal and public health efforts.},

On average, a 1-SD increase in self-control was associated with a reduction in the probability of unemployment of 1.4 percentage points after adjustment for intelligence, social class, and gender. From labor-market entry to middle age, individuals with low self-control experienced 1.6 times as many months of unemployment as those with high self-control. Analysis of monthly unemployment data before and during the 1980s recession showed that individuals with low self-control experienced the greatest increases in unemployment during the recession. Our results underscore the critical role of self-control in shaping life-span trajectories of occupational success and in affecting how macroeconomic conditions affect unemployment levels in the population.},

Using two large, comparative data sets, we find that the proportion of women elected representatives at the time of the survey has no significant effect on the gender gap.

The results are in line with political socialization, which posits that the impact of political context is greatest during adolescence and early adulthood.

Participants' perceptions of perpetrator accountability, support for punishment, level of concern about the bias, and support for various efforts to reduce it (e.g., education) were assessed. Taken together, the results suggest that perpetrators of discrimination are held less accountable and often seen as less worthy of punishment when their behavior is attributed to implicit rather than to explicit bias. Moreover, at least under some circumstances, people express less concern about, and are less likely to support efforts to combat, implicit compared with explicit bias. Implications for efforts to communicate the science of implicit bias without undermining accountability for the discrimination it engenders are discussed.},

  abstract = {Abstract Methamphetamine (Meth) is a potent and commonly abused psychostimulant. Meth alters neuron and astrocyte activity; yet the underlying mechanism(s) is not fully understood. Here we assessed the impact of acute Meth on human fetal astrocytes (HFAs) using whole-cell patch-clamping. We found that HFAs displayed a large voltage-gated K+ efflux (IKv) through Kv/Kv-like channels during membrane depolarization, and a smaller K+ influx (Ikir) via inward-rectifying Kir/Kir-like channels during membrane hyperpolarization. Meth at a ?recreational? (20~?M) or toxic/fatal (100~?M) concentration depolarized resting membrane potential (RMP) and suppressed IKv/Kv-like. These changes were associated with a decreased time constant (?), and mimicked by blocking the two-pore domain K+ (K2P)/K2P-like and Kv/Kv-like channels, respectively. Meth also diminished IKir/Kir-like, but only at toxic/fatal levels. Given that Meth is a potent agonist for the trace amine-associated receptor type-1 (TAAR1), and TAAR1-coupled cAMP/cAMP-activated protein kinase (PKA) cascade, we further evaluated whether the Meth impact on K+ efflux was mediated by this pathway. We found that antagonizing TAAR1 with N-(3-Ethoxyphenyl)-4-(1-pyrrolidinyl)-3-(trifluoromethyl)benzamide (EPPTB) reversed Meth-induced suppression of IKv/Kv-like; and inhibiting PKA activity by H89 abolished Meth effects on suppressing IKv/Kv-like. Antagonizing TAAR1 might also attenuate Meth-induced RMP depolarization. Voltage-gated Ca2+ currents were not detected in HFAs. These novel findings demonstrate that Meth suppresses IKv/Kv-like by facilitating the TAAR1/Gs/cAMP/PKA cascade and altering the kinetics of Kv/Kv-like channel gating, but reduces K2P/K2P-like channel activity through other pathway(s), in HFAs. Given that Meth-induced decrease in astrocytic K+ efflux through K2P/K2P-like and Kv/Kv-like channels reduces extracellular K+ levels, such reduction could consequently contribute to a decreased excitability of surrounding neurons.

This apparent lack of concern has been attributed to people's deeply-entrenched belief in economic mobility \textendash{} the belief that through hard work, determination, and skill people are able to rise up the economic ladder. Little is known, however, about why Americans so strongly believe in economic mobility. In five studies (N = 3112, including two pre-registered studies, one with a large, income-stratified sample), I examine the relationship between economic inequality and the belief in economic mobility. I find that people (accurately) perceive a negative relationship between economic inequality and economic mobility, and that this is due to the attributions they make about wealth and poverty. As economic inequality rises, people increasingly attribute economic success and failure to external factors that are beyond a person's control (vs. internal dispositions), and therefore expect economic mobility to drop. As a consequence, people's tendency to underestimate economic inequality reinforces their belief in economic mobility. I discuss how these findings contribute to our understanding of lay beliefs about the economic system and public opinion regarding inequality.},

Despite lacking conventional meanings, ``nonsense'' words elicited a high level of consistency in the produced drawings. Meaning attributions made to nonsense words corresponded with meaning attributions made by separate people to drawings that were inspired by the name. Na\"ive participants were able to recover the name that inspired the drawing with greater-than-chance accuracy. These results suggest that people make liberal and consistent use of non-arbitrary relationships between forms and meanings.

Motivation peaked when the calendar's starting day (e.g., Sunday) matched the current day (e.g., Sunday) compared to when the calendar started on a different day (e.g., Monday, Studies 1a, 1b, 2). Viewing a calendar that portrayed the week as starting today (vs. a control calendar) also translated to greater self-reported progress on three personal goals over the next day (Study 2). The calendar format effect was present in both between-subjects designs (Study 1a, 1b, 2) and within-subjects design (Study 3). These studies extend research on the influence of temporal categories on projected goal pursuit to show the impact of calendar formats on motivation in the moment.},

Syntax (the rules for combining words into sentences) has been robustly shown to be a cue to word meaning. But how can infants access syntactic information when they are still acquiring the meanings of words? We investigated the contribution of two cues that may help infants break into the syntax and give a boost to their lexical acquisition: phrasal prosody (speech melody) and function words, both of which are accessible early in life and correlate with syntactic structure in the world's languages. We show that 18-month-old infants use prosody and function words to recover sentences' syntactic structure, which in turn constrains the possible meanings of novel words: Participants (N = 48 in each of two experiments) interpreted a novel word as referring to either an object or an action, given its position within the prosodic-syntactic structure of sentences.},

We find that even stereotypically threatening out-group agents are believed to have a good true self (Experiment 1). More importantly, consideration of an in-group and out-group members' true self reduces intergroup bias, both in the form of explicit evaluative judgments (Experiment 2) and actual donation behavior (Experiment 3). Across studies, the palliative effects of thinking of an individual's true self generalize to that individual's entire group.

  abstract = {Joint attention refers to the coordinated attention between social partners to an object of shared interest, usually involving shared gaze toward the object. In the laboratory, however, joint attention is often investigated using computerized gaze cueing tasks that do not allow shared gaze. Instead, these computerized tasks require the participant to maintain fixation on the virtual partner's face, while the partner gazes to the left or right. Here we designed a modified gaze cueing task that better simulates a natural joint attention episode by allowing shared gaze, while still maintaining tight experimental control. In our computerized task the participant's gaze and the gaze of a virtual partner were manipulated independently, resulting in shared or unshared gaze. Following each gaze shift of the virtual partner a touch stimulus was delivered on one of the cheeks of the participant. We analyzed behavioral and neural (electro-encephalography) responses to the touch. Faster reaction-times and stronger lateralization of alpha power were observed when the touched cheek was in a jointly attended hemispace compared with a singly attended or unattended hemispace. Importantly, these effects were unique to joint attention and could not be explained as the additive effects of own gaze and gaze cue direction. Underlining its social nature, we found that the behavioral effect was absent when we repeated our experiment with nonsocial cues (arrows) instead of gaze cues. Furthermore, when we compared trustworthy with untrustworthy virtual partners (trustworthiness judgements based on facial appearance) we found the effect only for trustworthy and not for untrustworthy virtual partners. We conclude that joint attention based on shared gaze influences attentional orienting such that cross-modal sensory processing at the jointly attended location is facilitated, particularly when the partner is trustworthy. This indicates that social interactions and trustworthiness judgements affect cortical and behavioral responses to sensory information.},

Accordingly, sensorimotor and visual processes should provide congruent emotional information about a facial expression. Here, we report evidence that challenges this view. Specifically, the repeated execution of facial expressions has the opposite effect on the recognition of a subsequent facial expression than the repeated viewing of facial expressions. Moreover, the findings of the motor condition, but not of the visual condition, were correlated with a nonsensory condition in which participants imagined an emotional situation. These results can be well accounted for by the idea that facial expression recognition is not always mediated by motor processes but can also be recognized on visual information alone.},

A model-based strategy leverages a cognitive model of potential actions and their consequences to make goal-directed choices, whereas a model-free strategy evaluates actions based solely on their reward history. Research in adults has begun to elucidate the psychological mechanisms and neural substrates underlying these learning processes and factors that influence their relative recruitment. However, the developmental trajectory of these evaluative strategies has not been well characterized. In this study, children, adolescents, and adults performed a sequential reinforcement-learning task that enabled estimation of model-based and model-free contributions to choice. Whereas a model-free strategy was apparent in choice behavior across all age groups, a model-based strategy was absent in children, became evident in adolescents, and strengthened in adults. These results suggest that recruitment of model-based valuation systems represents a critical cognitive component underlying the gradual maturation of goal-directed behavior.},

  abstract = {Abstract Opioid-induced hyperalgesia and analgesic tolerance can lead to dose escalation and inadequate pain treatment with ?-opioid receptor agonists. Opioids cause tonic activation of glutamate NMDA receptors (NMDARs) at primary afferent terminals, increasing nociceptive input. However, the signaling mechanisms responsible for opioid-induced activation of pre-synaptic NMDARs in the spinal dorsal horn remain unclear. In this study, we determined the role of MAPK signaling in opioid-induced pre-synaptic NMDAR activation caused by chronic morphine administration. Whole-cell recordings of excitatory post-synaptic currents (EPSCs) were performed on dorsal horn neurons in rat spinal cord slices. Chronic morphine administration markedly increased the frequency of miniature EPSCs, increased the amplitude of monosynaptic EPSCs evoked from the dorsal root, and reduced the paired-pulse ratio of evoked EPSCs. These changes were fully reversed by an NMDAR antagonist and normalized by inhibiting extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), p38, or c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). Furthermore, intrathecal injection of a selective ERK1/2, p38, or JNK inhibitor blocked pain hypersensitivity induced by chronic morphine treatment. These inhibitors also similarly attenuated a reduction in morphine's analgesic effect in rats. In addition, co-immunoprecipitation assays revealed that NMDARs formed a protein complex with ERK1/2, p38, and JNK in the spinal cord and that chronic morphine treatment increased physical interactions of NMDARs with these three MAPKs. Our findings suggest that opioid-induced hyperalgesia and analgesic tolerance are mediated by tonic activation of pre-synaptic NMDARs via three functionally interrelated MAPKs at the spinal cord level.

Using data from 8,458 employed individuals, we examined the combined effects of individuals' actual personality traits and jobs' expert-rated personality demands on earnings. Results from a response surface analysis indicated that the fit between individuals' actual personality and the personality demands of their jobs is a predictor of income. Conclusions of this combined analysis were partly opposite to conclusions reached in previous studies using conventional regression methods. Individuals can earn additional income of more than their monthly salary per year if they hold a job that fits their personality. Thus, at least for some traits, economic success depends not only on having a ``successful personality'' but also, in part, on finding the best niche for one's personality. We discuss the findings with regard to labor-market policies and individuals' job-selection strategies.},

The impact of strain from balancing these multiple roles was investigated considering student satisfaction within different domains (i.e., work, family, and school) as a predictor of students' negative affect in a sample of working college students from across the country (via MTurk; N = 145). Participants were required to be enrolled in a university or college at least part time, employed at least part time, and living with another person. Results revealed that social integration was negatively associated with negative affect across domains. Work satisfaction was predictive of negative affect, and it was also moderated by social integration, {$\beta$} = -.93, t(136) = 2.08, p = .04. School and family satisfaction, however, were not significant predictors of negative affect, thus suggesting the unique roles of each specific domain. This work suggests it is important to focus on the unique experiences of modernday college students, and the challenges of balancing work, family, and school, in order to better support this rapidly growing unique group of individuals.},

We confirmed our predictions that (1) overall help-seekers would underestimate the likelihood that those they approached for help would agree to their requests and that (2) this underestimation error would be smaller for participants making requests of friends. We also found that (3) the underestimation effect persists even for those making requests of friends and (4) help-seekers expected the rate of helping between the two groups to vary more than it did.

Confidence was reduced with variable (vs. weak) evidence, even across conditions matched for difficulty. Building on this dissociation, we constructed a paradigm in which participants (N = 20) could choose to seek further information before making their decision. The data provided clear support for the hypothesis that subjective confidence predicts information seeking in decision making: Participants were more likely to sample additional information before giving a response in the condition with low confidence, despite matched accuracy. In a preregistered replication (N = 50), these findings were replicated with increased task difficulty levels.},

Although past work has begun detailing characteristics of targets that can bias pain judgments (e.g., race, gender), the current work examines a novel source of bias inherent to all targets: structural characteristics of the human face. Specifically, we present four studies demonstrating that facial width-to-height ratio, a stable feature of all faces, biases pain judgments. Compared to those with low facial width-to-height ratio, individuals with high facial width-to-height ratio are perceived as experiencing less pain in otherwise identical situations (Studies 1, 2, \& 3), and as needing less pain medication to salve their injuries (Study 4). This process was observed for White but not Black targets (Study 2), and manipulations of facial width-to-height ratio affected pain perceptions even when target identity was held constant (Study 4). Together, these findings implicate face structure in judgments of others' pain.},

However, given its links to self-control\textemdash itself a necessary factor for repaying debts\textemdash the possibility arises that gratitude might enhance other virtues unrelated to exchange that depend on an ability to resist temptation. Here, we examined gratitude's ability to function as a ``parent'' virtue by focusing on its ability to reduce cheating. Using real-time behavior-based measures of cheating, we demonstrated that gratitude, as opposed to neutrality and the more general positive emotional state of happiness, reduces cheating in both a controlled laboratory setting (N = 156) and a more anonymous online setting (N = 141). This finding suggests that not all moral qualities need to be studied in silos but, rather, that hierarchies exist wherein certain virtues might give rise to seemingly unrelated others.},

Supporting this view, recent                     findings demonstrate that sadness exacerbates financial impatience even when the                     sadness is unrelated to the economic decision at hand. Such findings might                     reinforce the view that emotions must always be suppressed to combat impatience.                     But if emotions serve adaptive functions, then certain emotions might be capable                     of reducing excessive impatience for delayed rewards. We found evidence                     supporting this alternative view. Specifically, we found that (a) the emotion                     gratitude reduces impatience even when real money is at stake, and (b) the                     effects of gratitude are differentiable from those of the more general positive                     state of happiness. These findings challenge the view that individuals must tamp                     down affective responses through effortful self-regulation to reach more patient                     and adaptive economic decisions.},

One exception is the gender bias habit-breaking intervention (Carnes et al., 2015), which, in a cluster-randomized trial involving all but two departmental clusters (N=92) in the 6 STEMM focused schools/colleges at the University of Wisconsin\textendash Madison, led to increases in gender bias awareness and self-efficacy to promote gender equity in academic science departments and perceptions of a more positive departmental climate. Following this initial success, the present study compares, in a preregistered analysis, hiring rates of new female faculty pre- and post-manipulation. Whereas the proportion of women hired by control departments remained stable over time, the proportion of women hired by intervention departments increased by an estimated 18 percentage points (OR=2.23, dOR=0.34). Though the preregistered analysis did not achieve conventional levels of statistical significance (p{$<$}0.07), the study has a hard upper limit on statistical power, as the cluster-randomized trial has a maximum sample size of 92 departmental clusters. These findings, however, have undeniable practical significance for the advancement of women in science, and provide promising evidence that psychological interventions can facilitate gender equity and diversity.},

To initiate study of this important topic, we conducted two experiments in which participants simulated emotional events before learning the hypothetical outcome of each event via narratives. Memory was assessed for emotional details contained in those narratives. Positive simulation resulted in a liberal response bias for positive information and a conservative bias for negative information. Events preceded by positive simulation were considered more favorably in retrospect. In contrast, negative simulation had no impact on subsequent memory. Results were similar across an immediate and delayed memory test and for past and future simulation. These results provide novel insights into the cognitive consequences of episodic future simulation and build on the optimism-bias literature by showing that adopting a favorable outlook results in a rosy memory.},

  abstract = {Abstract Inflammatory insult to the central nervous system (CNS) can lead to development of depression, and subsequently depression is the most frequent psychiatric comorbidity following ischemic stroke, often limiting recovery and rehabilitation in patients. The initiators of inflammatory pathways in the CNS are microglia activated in response to acute ischemic stress, and anti-depressants have been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects in the CNS, promoting neuronal survival following ischemic insult. We have previously shown that the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) fluoxetine and citalopram promote neuronal survival after oxygen-glucose deprivation, an in~vitro model of ischemia, by attenuating the release of glutamate and D-serine from activated microglia. Interestingly, we found that fluoxetine-treated microglial cultures contained fewer numbers of cells compared to other groups and hypothesized that fluoxetine and citalopram attenuated the release of glutamate and D-serine by promoting the apoptosis of microglia. The present study aimed to test and compare antidepressants from three distinct classes (tricyclics, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and SSRIs) on microglial apoptosis. Primary microglia were treated with 1~?g/mL lipopolysaccharide and/or 10~?M antidepressants, and various apoptotic markers were assayed. Fluoxetine and its metabolite norfluoxetine decreased protein levels in cell lysates, decreased cell viability of microglia, and increased the expression of the apoptotic marker cleaved-caspase 3 in microglia. Live/dead nuclear staining also showed that fluoxetine- or norfluoxetine-treated cultures contained greater numbers of dying microglial cells compared to vehicle-treated cultures. Cultures treated with citalopram, phenelzine, or imipramine showed no evidence of inducing microglial apoptosis. Our results demonstrate that fluoxetine and norfluoxetine induce the apoptotic death of microglia, which may serve as a mechanism to attenuate the release of glutamate and D-serine from activated microglia.

We predict that using a foreign language could reduce the illusions of causality. A total of 36 native English speakers participated in Experiment 1, 80 native Spanish speakers in Experiment 2. They performed a standard contingency learning task, which can be used to detect causal illusions. Participants who performed the task in their native tongue replicated the illusion of causality effect, whereas those performing the task in their foreign language were more accurate in detecting that the two events were causally unrelated. Our results suggest that presenting the information in a foreign language could be used as a strategy to debias individuals against causal illusions, thereby facilitating more accurate judgements and decisions in non-contingent situations. They also contribute to the debate on the nature and underlying mechanisms of the foreign language effect, given that the illusion of causality is rooted in basic associative processes.},

Similar to some repetitive behaviors in Gilles de la Tourette syndrome (GTS) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), premonitory urges are assumed to play a critical role in maintaining skin picking behavior, by creating a vicious cycle. The present study is the first to investigate the quality of premonitory urges, as well as the temporal relationship between urges and skin picking behavior in individuals with skin picking disorder. Quality and intensity of premonitory urges was assessed in 15 individuals with skin picking. Urge quality was assessed with the translated University of S\~ao Paulo Sensory Phenomena Scale (USP-SPS). Urge intensity was assessed continuously over 20~min using a computer-based tool. Participants were instructed either a) to pick freely or b) to suppress their skin picking behavior. Skin picking events during the free and suppression condition were recorded on video and coded manually. Regarding the types of urges, individuals with skin picking reported mainly physical urge sensations (80\%), visual ''just-right'' feelings (80\%), and urge-only sensations (80\%) similar to urges reported by GTS and OCD patients. Moreover, the data showed a strong temporal relationship between the intensity of premonitory urges and the emergence of skin picking behavior (R2~=~.23) that was weakened when skin picking was suppressed (R2~=~.06). The results suggest that skin picking behavior is maintained by premonitory urges and that this vicious cycle of negative reinforcement can be, at least partially, broken by suppressing skin picking behavior.},

We required participants to memorize a set of individual actions while ignoring the underlying social interactions. We found that although the social-interaction aspect was task irrelevant, the interactive actions were stored in WM as chunks that were not affected by memory load (Experiments 1 and 2); however, inverting the human actions vertically abolished this chunking effect (Experiment 3). These results suggest that WM automatically and efficiently used semantic knowledge about interactive actions to store them and support the chunk-storage hypothesis.},

  abstract = {Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by selective death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, degeneration of the nigrostriatal pathway, increases in glutamatergic synapses in the striatum and aggregation of {$\alpha$}-synuclein. Evidence suggests that oligomeric species of {$\alpha$}-synuclein ({$\alpha$}SO) are the genuine neurotoxins of PD. Although several studies have supported the direct neurotoxic effects of {$\alpha$}SO on neurons, their effects on astrocytes have not been directly addressed. Astrocytes are essential to several steps of synapse formation and function, including secretion of synaptogenic factors, control of synaptic elimination and stabilization, secretion of neural/glial modulators, and modulation of extracellular ions, and neurotransmitter levels in the synaptic cleft. Here, we show that {$\alpha$}SO induced the astrocyte reactivity and enhanced the synaptogenic capacity of human and murine astrocytes by increasing the levels of the known synaptogenic molecule transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-{$\beta$}1). Moreover, intracerebroventricular injection of {$\alpha$}SO in mice increased the number of astrocytes, the density of excitatory synapses, and the levels of TGF-{$\beta$}1 in the striatum of injected animals. Inhibition of TGF-{$\beta$}1 signaling impaired the effect of the astrocyte-conditioned medium on glutamatergic synapse formation in vitro and on striatal synapse formation in vivo, whereas addition of TGF-{$\beta$}1 protected mesencephalic neurons against synapse loss triggered by {$\alpha$}SO. Together, our data suggest that {$\alpha$}SO have important effects on astrocytic functions and describe TGF-{$\beta$}1 as a new endogenous astrocyte-derived molecule involved in the increase in striatal glutamatergic synaptic density present in early stages of PD.

Cortico-cortical evoked potentials (CCEPs), utilize low frequency stimulation to map cerebral networks. They were used to study connections of the human insula.
Methods
CCEP data was acquired from each sub-region of the dominant and non-dominant insula in 30 patients who underwent stereo-EEG. Connectivity strength to the various cortical regions was obtained via a measure of root mean square (RMS), calculated from each gyrus of the insula and ranked into weighted means.
Results
The results of all cumulative CCEP responses for each individual gyrus were represented by circro plots. Forty-nine individual CCEP pairs were stimulated across all the gyri from the right and left insula. In brief, the left insula contributed more greatly to language areas. Sensory function, pain, saliency processing and vestibular function were more heavily implicated from the right insula. Connections to the primary auditory cortex arose from both insula regions. Both posterior insula regions showed significant contralateral connectivity. Ipsilateral mesial temporal connections were seen from both insula regions. In visual function, we further report the novel finding of a direct connection between the right posterior insula and left visual cortex.
Significance
The insula is a major multi-modal network hub with the cerebral cortex having major roles in language, sensation, auditory, visual, limbic and vestibular functions as well as saliency processing. In temporal lobe epilepsy surgery failure, the insula may be implicated as an extra temporal cause, due to the strong mesial temporal connectivity findings.},

The research literature is conflicted: Importing firms may demand that trading partners observe higher labor and environmental standards, or they may penalize higher standards that raise costs. This study uses new data on retailers and manufacturers to analyze how firm-level trade responds to information about social standards. Contrary to the ``race to the bottom'' hypothesis, it finds that retail importers reward exporters for complying with social standards. In difference-in-differences estimates from over 2,000 manufacturing establishments in 36 countries, achieving compliance is associated with a 4\% [1\%, 7\%] average increase in annual purchasing.

Observers of this kind of behavior have been shown to react negatively in such situations, and in extreme cases, may even leave their group. The current work set out to test how this reaction might be prevented. We assumed that group-norm affirmations can buffer leaving intentions in response to group-norm violations and tested three potential mechanisms underlying the buffering effect of group-norm affirmations. To this end, we conducted three experiments in which we manipulated group-norm violations and group-norm affirmations. In Study 1, we found group-norm affirmations to buffer leaving intentions after group-norm violations. However, we did not find support for the assumption that group-norm affirmations change how a behavior is evaluated or preserve group members' identification with their group. Thus, neither of these variables can explain the buffering effect of group-norm affirmations. Studies 2 \& 3 revealed that group-norm affirmations instead reduce perceived effectiveness of the norm-violator, which in turn predicted lower leaving intentions. The present findings will be discussed based on previous research investigating the consequences of norm violations.},

When members deviate from group norms, other members often (a) respond with confrontation (e.g., deviate-directed communication or exclusion of the deviate from the group), or (b) with escape, that is, with leaving the group themselves. However, to date, it is unclear under which specific circumstances these reactions occur. Two experiments were conducted to address this question. In both studies, participants perceived norm-deviant behavior of a group member to subvert the group's identity, which in turn predicted exclusion of the deviate and leaving the group. Group leaving, however, was especially likely when the norm-deviation was perceived to change the group's norm, either due to being accepted (vs. not accepted) by others (Study 1) or due to being shown by a group leader (Study 2). Furthermore, norm-deviations by a leader resulted in a lower social identification with the group, which in turn predicted leaving. These findings suggest that group members leave their group in response to others' norm-deviations only if these deviations induce changes in the group norm and, thereby, reduce the fit between members' self-concepts and the group.},

Nowadays such large-scale projects are in fact very difficult to take place, considering environmental, geopolitical, and funding issues. In addition, reprocessing vintage seismic profiles using up-to-date software and tools, it is now possible to further increase their original signal-to-noise ratio. Italian offshore areas have been widely investigated by a dense network of multichannel seismic reflection profiles, acquired by the Italian Authorities in the years 1960, 1970, and 1980 of the last century in the perspective of mineral prospecting. This asset of data has been recovered, reprocessed, and made accessible within a demanding project undertaken by Istituto Nazionale di Oceanografia e di Geofisica Sperimentale (OGS). The present work aims at describing the data recovery and reprocessing methodologies applied to enhance the quality of these vintage multichannel-seismic reflection profiles, and at detailing how to access this huge dataset, that have been made compliant with the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) and available through the OGS-SNAP data management web portal.

We combine behavioural probes with structural and functional brain imaging to provide the first comprehensive analysis of ToM deficits following stroke using the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET). First, fMRI was used to identify the functional brain network involved in a non-clinical cohort. Results indicated that, relative to a control task, the RMET increased activity in a widespread functional bilateral network comprising frontal and temporo-parietal areas. To investigate how damage to grey and white matter components of this network can lead to ToM impairment, parcel-based lesion-symptom mapping (PLSM), white-matter tract-wise statistical analysis (TSA) and disconnectome symptom mapping (DSM) were performed using structural images from 64 stroke patients. PLSM results revealed that low scores on the RMET were associated with damage centered around the right posterior frontal gyrus and insula. TSA and DSM results further revealed that low RMET scores were associated with damage to white-matter tracts connecting frontal and temporo-parietal components of the RMET functional network. Together, these findings suggest that making judgements about the mental states of others imposes demands on a large functional network that can easily be disrupted, both by damage to grey matter areas that form part of the network directly, or the white-matter pathways that connect them.},

More importantly, MS effects on money attitudes were smaller when people's trait spirituality was high (vs. low; Studies 1, 2, 3) and when people were primed to experience spirituality (vs. happiness control condition; Study 4). For low spirituality people, the association between MS and prosocial spending also depended on the capacity of money spending to contribute positively to one's feelings of self-worth (Study 3). Theoretical implications and future directions are discussed.},

Thus, a rational observer should learn less from bad outcomes when they are likely to have been generated by a hidden cause, and this pattern should reverse when hidden causes are likely to generate good outcomes. To test this hypothesis, we conducted two experiments (N = 80, N = 255) in which we explicitly manipulated the behavior of hidden agents. This gave rise to both kinds of learning asymmetries in the same paradigm, as predicted by a novel Bayesian model.

  abstract = {Abstract Huntington's Disease (HD) is an autosomal-dominant neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by involuntary body movements, cognitive impairment, and psychiatric disorder. The metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) plays an important role in HD and we have recently demonstrated that mGluR5-positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) can ameliorate pathology and the phenotypic signs of a mouse model of HD. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms involved in mGluR5 PAMs effect on memory. Our results demonstrate that subchronic treatment with the mGluR5 PAM VU0409551 was effective in reversing the memory deficits exhibited by BACHD mice, a mouse model for HD. Moreover, VU0409551 treatment stabilized mGluR5 at the cellular plasma membrane of BACHD mice, increasing the expression of several genes important for synaptic plasticity, including c-Fos, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, Arc/Arg3.1, syntaxin 1A, and post-synaptic density-95. In addition, VU0409551 treatment also increased dendritic spine density and maturation and augmented the number of pre-synaptic sites. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that VU0409551 triggered the activation of cell signaling pathways important for synaptic plasticity, enhancing the level of dendritic spine maturation and rescuing BACHD memory impairment.

  abstract = {It is widely assumed that context reinstatement benefits memory, but our experiments revealed that context reinstatement can systematically distort memory. Participants viewed pictures of objects superimposed over scenes, and we later tested their ability to differentiate these old objects from similar new objects. Context reinstatement was manipulated by presenting objects on the reinstated or switched scene at test. Not only did context reinstatement increase correct recognition of old objects, but it also consistently increased incorrect recognition of similar objects as old ones. This false recognition effect was robust, as it was found in several experiments, occurred after both immediate and delayed testing, and persisted with high confidence even after participants were warned to avoid the distorting effects of context. To explain this memory illusion, we propose that context reinstatement increases the likelihood of confusing conceptual and perceptual information, potentially in medial temporal brain regions that integrate this information.},

  abstract = {When deciding between two options, settling can be difficult if one option is superior on one dimension but inferior on another. To arrive at a conclusion, people may gather further information, thereby running the risk of prolonging or blocking the decision-making process or even making suboptimal decisions. Here, we suggest that random decision aids may prove fruitful by reducing the need for further information. Five experiments (total N = 997) examined how information need is influenced after making a preliminary decision between two options and then receiving a suggestion from a random decision aid (a coin flip). Across studies, coin participants are less likely to request additional information (Study 1 and two follow-up studies, combined p = .021) and indicate a lower need for additional information (Study 2, p = .023, and Study 3, p = .001) compared to a control condition without a coin flip. Interestingly, participants do not necessarily adhere to the coin but stick to their preliminary decision as much as or even more than the control group, suggesting that the decision aid does not determine the decision outcome. This is true for hypothetical decisions between changing versus maintaining the status quo without an objectively correct solution (Studies 1, 1b, and 1c), for a decision between two options with an objectively correct solution (Study 2), and for a real monetary decision without an objectively correct solution (Study 3). Random decision aids may thus help to avoid decision blocks or the collection of too much information.},

Here, we manipulated covert spatial attention and had participants (total N = 48) reproduce multiple properties (color, orientation, location) of a target item. Object-feature binding was assessed by applying probabilistic models to the joint distribution of feature errors: Feature reports for the same object could be correlated (and thus bound together) or independent. We found that splitting attention across multiple locations degrades object integrity, whereas rapid shifts of spatial attention maintain bound objects. Moreover, we document a novel attentional phenomenon, wherein participants exhibit unintentional fluctuations\textemdash lapses of spatial attention\textemdash yet nevertheless preserve object integrity at the wrong location. These findings emphasize the importance of a single focus of spatial attention for object-feature binding, even when that focus is dynamically moving across the visual field.},

In this study, we showed that unmedicated children (ages 6\textendash 12) with ADHD, when probed during a standard go/no-go task, reported more mind blanking (a mental state characterized by the absence of reportable content) than did control participants. This increase in mind blanking happened at the expense of both focused and wandering thoughts. We also found that methylphenidate reverted the level of mind blanking to baseline (i.e., the level of mind blanking reported by control children without ADHD). However, this restoration led to mind wandering more than to focused attention. In a second experiment, we extended these findings to adults who had subclinical ADHD. These results suggest that executive functions impaired in ADHD are required not only to sustain external attention but also to maintain an internal train of thought.},

Correlations were based on the item-level ERPs at each electrode site and time slice while a false-discovery-rate correction was applied. Early effects of visual complexity were seen around 50 ms after word onset, followed by the earliest sustained orthographic effects around 100 to 150 ms, with the bulk of orthographic and lexical influences arising after 200 ms. Effects of a semantic variable (concreteness) emerged later, at around 300 ms. The overall time course of these ERP effects is in line with hierarchical, cascaded, interactive accounts of word recognition, in which fast feed-forward influences are consolidated by top-down feedback via recurrent processing loops.},

One of the main candidate as the cortical source of this ERP component is the inferior intraparietal sulcus (IPS). Moreover, previous neuroimaging studies put forth evidence for the presence of a distributed VWM network involving also prefrontal areas and in particular the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Nonetheless, the understanding of the functional role of ACC is still debated. We recorded the high-density EEG in 20 healthy participants undergoing a VWM and a control task. Explorative cluster-based permutation statistics confirmed the posterior memory load dependent CDA modulation, but also identified an additional anterior cluster of electrodes whose amplitude was modulated by memory load. The source reconstruction revealed a memory load dependent activation in the IPS but also in the ACC, suggesting that these two areas might be nodes of a fronto-parietal circuit underlying VWM maintenance. Crucially, parietal and prefrontal areas showed a temporal dissociation, since IPS was more engaged in the early phase of visual information storage while the ACC was more active during the late phase. This pattern suggests a functional dissociation between the parietal cortex, which is involved in encoding and storage of information, and prefrontal areas, subserving cognitive control processes, including the boosting and protection of information from decay. Remarkably, the connection strength between IPS and ACC predicted the individual number of items held in memory. These findings are discussed within the theoretical account of a neural distributed model of VWM.},

While their actions are sometimes deemed morally courageous, existing evidence that whistleblowers are primarily motivated by moral concerns is mixed. Moreover, little is known about the extent to which moral concerns predict whistleblowing relative to other organizational and situational factors. To address these gaps, we present two studies demonstrating the power of moral concerns in predicting whistleblowing decisions. Study 1 uses a large cross-sectional dataset of federal employees (N = 42,020) to test how moral concerns predict real-world whistleblowing decisions relative to other factors. Study 2 provides a more controlled replication of the association between moral concerns and whistleblowing decisions in an online sample of the U.S. workforce. Results revealed that moral concerns consistently predicted whistleblowing decisions above and beyond other organizational and situational factors. Specifically, whistleblowing decisions were associated with a tradeoff between moral concerns; whereby, concerns for the fair treatment of others beyond one's organization were associated with reporting unethical behavior, while loyalty to one's organization was associated with not reporting unethical behavior. Organizational factors, such as whether the organization educates its employees about how to disclose wrongdoing, showed a somewhat weaker association with whistleblowing decisions across studies. However, they were the only significant predictors of how people blew the whistle; that is, reporting unethical behavior through internal versus external channels. Together, these findings reveal important psychological motivations underlying whistleblowing, highlighting the power of moral concerns in these decisions and supporting conceptualizations of whistleblowing as an important example of moral courage.},

Using the legal system as an example domain in which people receive punishment, the current work employed two complementary approaches to examine how punishment-related concepts emerge. Study 1 tested both 6- to 8-year-olds and adults to ascertain which components of ``end-state'' punishment concepts emerge early in development and remain stable over time, and which components of punishment concepts change with age. Children, like adults, agreed with and spontaneously generated behavioral explanations for incarceration. However, children were more likely than adults to attribute incarceration to internal characteristics. Neither children nor adults reported that incarceration stems from societal-level factors such as poverty. Study 2 built on the results of Study 1 by probing the extent to which early punishment-related concepts in the legal domain emerge from a specific form of social experience\textemdash namely, parental incarceration.

Chapters and key scenes were coded for redemption, contamination, and affective tone. Life chapters became less contaminated and more emotionally positive over time. Furthermore, positive affective tone in participants' chapters and scenes corresponded with secure attachment tendencies. Thus, there exists a tendency to perceive one's love life as increasingly positive over time (or chapters), and the love life narrative identity of securely attached individuals is largely defined by positive tone.},

But what happens when powerful people also are ambivalent? On the basis of the self-validation theory of judgment, we hypothesized that power and ambivalence would interact to predict individuals' action. Because power can validate individuals' reactions, we reasoned that feeling powerful strengthens whatever reactions people have during a decision. It can strengthen univalent reactions and increase action orientation, as shown in past research. Among people who hold an ambivalent judgment, however, those who feel powerful would be less action oriented than those who feel powerless. Two experiments provide evidence for this hypothesized interactive effect of power and ambivalence on individuals' action tendencies during both positive decisions (promoting an employee; Experiment 1) and negative decisions (firing an employee; Experiment 2). In summary, when individuals' reactions are ambivalent, power increases the likelihood of inaction.},

The main objective of this work is to provide new evidence in favour of two claims from the embodied cognition framework: (1) memory is grounded on the sensorimotor system, that is, memory shares processing resources with the sensorimotor system, and (2) memory serves at least in part to support action. For this purpose, the present experiment aimed to show that the action context modulates the motor simulation and, consequently, the memory of manipulable objects. Participants were presented with short phrases comprising the name of a manipulable object, and an action verb (``To take a cup'') or an attentional verb (``To see a cup''). During this phase, they had to put their hands in front of them in the control condition, whereas they had to keep them behind their back in the interfering condition. A cued recall test followed after a short distractive letter-matching task, with the verbs serving as cues. Results showed that memory of the words denoting manipulable objects was impaired by the interfering posture when associated with an action verb, but not when associated with an attentional verb. This suggests that a context which does not favour action interferes with motor simulation and thus decreases the memory of manipulable objects. These results provide strong evidence for a grounded account of memory and language.},

However, without a no-inclusion control condition, it is unclear whether inclusion elevates need satisfaction, whether ostracism depresses need satisfaction, or both. We introduce Cybertree\textemdash a control condition designed to provide a similar experience to Cyberball without inclusion. Individuals playing Cybertree did not differ from included individuals in terms of feeling ostracized, level of need satisfaction, and mood. Both Cyberball inclusion and Cybertree differed significantly from ostracized individuals.

But we know little about how people form these ideas about their likes and dislikes in the first place, in part because of a dearth of paradigms that enable researchers to experimentally change people's attribute preferences. Drawing on theory and methods in covariation detection and social cognition, we developed a paradigm that examines how people infer summarized preferences for novel attributes from functional attribute preferences: the extent to which the attribute predicts an individual's evaluations across multiple targets (e.g., a person's tendency to positively evaluate mates who are more vs. less attractive). In three studies, participants encountered manipulated information about their own functional preference for a novel attribute in a set of targets. They then inferred a summarized preference for the attribute. Summarized preferences corresponded strongly to the functional preference manipulation when targets varied on only one attribute. But additional complexity (in the form of a second novel attribute) caused summarized and functional preferences to diverge, and biases emerged: Participants reported stronger summarized preferences for the attribute when the population of targets possessed more of the attribute on average (regardless of functional preference strength). We also documented some support for a standard-of-comparison mechanism to explain this inferential bias. These studies elucidate factors that may warp the translation process from people's experienced evaluative responses in the world to their overall, summary judgments about their attribute preferences.},

This attribution decision influences one's opinion of the object (I like him). Misattribution occurs when the internal experience is triggered by one object (a prime), but attributed to another (a target). The present research used the Affect Misattribution Procedure to examine the influence of conceptual overlap between the prime and the target on misattribution of valenced internal experiences. For instance, would people misattribute the pleasure activated by a flower prime to a target flower more than to a person? We argue that the valence of the internal experience does not enter the attribution process alone, but is rather accompanied by semantic properties related to the object that generated the experience. Consequently, misattribution occurs more when prime and target are conceptually similar. Four experiments (Total N = 3183) supported that prediction, using diverse primes and targets. The results suggest that the semantic properties of the internal experience help guide the attribution process.},

  abstract = {Abstract Purkinje cells (PCs) convey the sole output of the cerebellar cortex to the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN). DCN neurons are enwrapped in densely organized extracellular matrix structures, known as perineuronal nets (PNNs). PNNs are typically found around fast-spiking GABAergic interneurons expressing parvalbumin but interestingly also exist surrounding other neurons, such as the neurons in the DCN and medial nucleus of the trapezoid body, which are the post-synaptic neurons of large axo-somatic synapses adapted for fast signaling. This characteristic localization prompted the hypothesis that PNNs might play a role in the maintenance and formation of large fast-signaling synapses. To elucidate the role of the PNN at these synapses, we investigated the electrophysiological and morphological properties of DCN synapses in hyaluronan and proteoglycan binding link protein 4 (Hapln4/Bral2) knockout (KO) mice around postnatal day (P)14. Hapln4/Bral2 is important for PNN structure, as it stabilizes the interaction between hyaluronan and proteoglycan. Here, using immunohistochemistry we show that Hapln4/Bral2 localized closely with GABAergic terminals. In DCN neurons of Hapln4/Bral2 KO mice, inhibitory synaptic strengths were reduced as compared to those in wild-type mice, whereas the properties of excitatory synapses were unaffected. The reduced IPSC amplitudes were mainly because of reduced numbers of releasable vesicles. Moreover, Hapln4/Bral2 deficiency reduced the number of PC GABAergic terminals in the DCN. These results demonstrate that Hapln4/Bral2 is a PNN component that selectively contributes to formation and transmission of PC-DCN synapses in the cerebellum.

Previous work has shown that judging the gaze direction of a non-foveally presented face is facilitated when the eyes of that face are directed towards the centre of the scene. This finding has been interpreted as an example of the human bias for misattributing observed ambiguous gaze signals as self-directed eye-contact. To test this interpretation against an alternative hypothesis that the facilitation is instead driven by the establishment of joint attention, we conducted two experiments in which we varied the participants' fixation location. In both experiments, we replicated the previous finding of facilitated gaze discrimination when the participants fixated centrally. However, this facilitation was abolished when participants fixated peripheral fixation crosses (Experiment 1) and reversed when participants fixated peripheral images of real-world objects (Experiment 2). Based on these data, we propose that the facilitation effect is consistent with the interpretation that gaze discrimination is facilitated when joint attention is established. This finding therefore extends previous work showing that engaging in joint attention facilitates a range of social cognitive processes.},

  abstract = {Recent evidence supports the idea that women use red clothing as a courtship tactic, and results from one study further suggested that women were more likely to wear red on days of high fertility in their menstrual cycles. Subsequent studies provided mixed support for the cycle-phase effect, although all such studies relied on counting methods of cycle-phase estimation and used between-subjects designs. By comparison, in the study reported here, we employed frequent hormone sampling to more accurately assess ovulatory timing and used a within-subjects design. We found that women were more likely to wear red during the fertile window than on other cycle days. Furthermore, within-subjects fluctuations in the ratio of estradiol to progesterone statistically mediated the within-subjects shifts in red-clothing choices. Our results appear to represent the first direct demonstration of specific hormone measurements predicting observable changes in women's courtship-related behaviors. We also demonstrate the advantages of hormonal determination of ovulatory timing for tests of cycle-phase shifts in psychology or behavior.},

In a large sample of scientific abstracts from the field of social psychology, we find both evaluative differences, such that conservatives are described more negatively than liberals, and explanatory differences, such that conservatism is more likely to be the focus of explanation than liberalism. In light of the ongoing debate about politicized science, a forecasting survey permitted scientists to state a priori empirical predictions about the results, and then change their beliefs in light of the evidence. Participating scientists accurately predicted the direction of both the evaluative and explanatory differences, but at the same time significantly overestimated both effect sizes. Scientists also updated their broader beliefs about political bias in response to the empirical results, providing a model for addressing divisive scientific controversies across fields.},

However, knowledge of how they are actually being used has been lacking. Extracting data from published reports of 207 recent experiments, we provide an empirical review of current practices concerning manipulation checks in social psychology. Our review suggests that there are serious deficiencies in the manner in which manipulation checks are used and interpreted. For example, published reports tend to contain highly limited quantitative reasoning about the effectiveness of manipulations, and researchers report little or nothing to address the possibility that manipulation checks might cause undesirable reactivity among participants. However, we argue that manipulation checks can be highly beneficial components of experiments when used properly, and they have untapped potential for the quantitative assessment of the strength of manipulations relative to the effect on the dependent variable (i.e., causal efficacy). To assist with such assessments, we provide empirical benchmarks for causal efficacy in social psychology. Additionally, we provide several recommendations for researchers and reviewers for improving the use and reporting of manipulation checks.},

Recent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) evidence from Ekstrand et~al. (2019) suggests that lexical reading is more associated with reflexive attentional orienting regions, whereas sublexical reading is more associated with voluntary attentional orienting regions. The current research sought to further examine the neuroanatomical relationship between reading and attention using a novel experimental design in fMRI. Participants performed four hybrid attentional orienting and reading-aloud tasks, where a reflexive or voluntary spatial cue preceded a lexical or sublexical target. Results indicated that lexical reading resulted in greater activation in the right temporoparietal junction, a reflexive orienting region. Sublexical reading resulted in greater activation in the left inferior frontal gyrus, left fusiform and inferior temporal gyrus, and right superior parietal lobule and intraparietal sulcus (voluntary orienting regions). Further, we found an interaction between reading and attention in the middle occipital gyrus. This study provides the most direct evidence to date that lexical and sublexical reading recruit differential attentional orienting regions during single-word reading in skilled readers. Implications for models of reading and attention, as well as for strategic remediation of their dysfunction, are discussed.},

Participants categorized a colored letter as a vowel or consonant or its color as ``warm'' or ``cold.''

Color frequency modulated the electroencephalogram amplitude at around 150 ms when participants repeated the color-classification task. When participants switched from the letter task to the color task, this effect was significantly delayed. Thus, even when prepared for, a task switch delays or prolongs encoding of the relevant perceptual dimension.},

Are ensemble mechanisms sensitive to these dynamic properties of groups? Here, observers estimated the average emotion of a crowd of dynamic faces. The members of some crowds changed their expressions synchronously, whereas individuals in other crowds acted asynchronously. Observers perceived the emotion of a synchronous group more precisely than the emotion of an asynchronous crowd or even a single dynamic face. These results demonstrate that ensemble representation is particularly sensitive to coordinated behavior, and they suggest that shared behavior is critical for understanding emotion in groups.},

In contrast, school-age children and young adolescents in Hong Kong outperformed their United Kingdom counterparts on all four EF tasks, a difference consistent with previous findings from preschool children.},

We conducted network analyses for AN and comorbid depression and anxiety using longitudinal data (N = 142) with measurements at baseline, and at 6-month, 12-month, and 24-month postrandomization follow-ups. We identified central symptoms and bridge symptoms and tested whether centrality values calculated at baseline were related to the prognostic utility of symptoms longitudinally. Feeling fat and fear of weight gain were among the most central symptoms of AN. Feelings of worthlessness had the highest bridge centrality connecting depression to AN. Symptom centrality at baseline was strongly related to prognostic utility (r2 = .52, .55). The finding that symptom centrality was strongly related to prognostic utility supports the validity of network theory in that central symptoms may have a particularly strong influence on clinical impairment and recovery. These analyses generate useful hypotheses about the etiology and maintenance of AN and related comorbidities and may inform future treatment development.},

  abstract = {Sleep is an important and time-consuming activity, during which animals may be particularly vulnerable. Selecting a suitable sleeping site is therefore essential for an individual's fitness. Here we test the importance of antipredator and thermoregulatory hypotheses for the sleeping site preference of a nocturnal primate, the Northern lesser galago (Galago senegalensis), in Northern Tanzania. During June to August of 2015 and 2016 we conducted daily surveys of sleeping sites to record the number of galagos and their location within the sleeping tree, and used focal follows to record when galagos reached and left sleeping sites. We collected vegetation data for sleeping sites (N = 47) and matched controls, and placed data loggers in sleeping (N = 14) and control locations to compare temperature and humidity. Sleeping group sizes were similar to that of G. senegalensis in The Gambia, and the mean proportion of visits in which galagos were present at each site was 27 {$\pm$} SD 25\%. Galagos slept on branches (N = 29), nests (N = 6), palm leaves (N = 6), and in tree cavities (N = 1). Palm leaves have not been previously recorded as regular sleeping sites for galagos and were overrepresented relative to their occurrence in the habitat. Random forest classification analysis revealed that galagos sleep in areas with greater canopy cover and connectivity, greater mid-level vegetation cover, higher tree density, and a greater number of Acacia trees. Sleeping locations had significantly lower mean temperatures but greater mean humidity than control locations. Our findings support predator avoidance and thermoregulation as drivers of nesting behavior. In particular, the characteristics of galago sleeping sites correspond well to those expected for protection from aerial predators, while those related to protection from terrestrial predators seem to play a minor role.},

Yet the probability that the relationship is real is a function not only of recurring results, but also of the quality and consistency of the empirical procedures that produced those results and that any meta-analysis necessarily inherits. Standardized protocols in data collection, analysis, and interpretation are foundations of empiricism and a healthy sign of a discipline's maturity. I propose that meta-analysis as typically applied in psychology will benefit from complementing aggregation of observed effect sizes with systematic examination of the standardization of the methodology that deterministically produced them. I describe potential units of analysis and offer two examples illustrating the benefits of such efforts. Ideally, this synergetic approach will advance theory by improving the quality of meta-analytic inferences.},

Policymakers and the general public may assume that such statements reflect objective conclusions, but their actual fidelity in representing science remains largely untested. For example, in recent decades, policy statements related to media effects have been released with increasing regularity. However, they have often provoked criticisms that they do not adequately reflect the state of the science on media effects. The News Media, Public Education and Public Policy Committee (a standing committee of APA's Division 46, the Media Psychology and Technology division) reviewed all publicly available policy statements on media effects produced by professional organizations and evaluated them using a standardized rubric. It was found that current policy statements tend to be more definitive than is warranted by the underlying science, and often ignore conflicting research results. These findings have broad implications for policy statements more generally, outside the field of media effects. In general, the committee suggests that professional organizations run the risk of misinforming the public when they release policy statements that do not acknowledge debates and inconsistencies in a field, or limitations of methodology. In formulating policy statements, advocacy organizations may wish to focus less on claiming consensus and more on acknowledging areas of agreement, areas of disagreement, and limitations.},

Altered histone 3 lysine 4 methylation and increased lysine-specific histone demethylase 1A (LSD1) expression in GBM tumours nonetheless suggest that epigenetic mechanisms are involved in GBM. We engineered a dual-action prodrug, which is activated by the high hydrogen peroxide levels associated with GBM cells. This quinone methide phenylaminecyclopropane prodrug releases the LSD1 inhibitor 2-phenylcyclopropylamine with the glutathione scavenger para-quinone methide to trigger apoptosis in GBM cells. Quinone methide phenylaminocyclopropane impaired GBM cell behaviours in two-dimensional and three-dimensional assays, and triggered cell apoptosis in several primary and immortal GBM cell cultures. These results support our double-hit hypothesis of potentially targeting LSD1 and quenching glutathione, in order to impair and kill GBM cells but not healthy astrocytes. Our data suggest this strategy is effective at selectively targeting GBM and potentially other types of cancers.

After they played the game, we assessed three aggression-related outcome variables (aggressive behavior, aggressive-thought accessibility, and aggressive affect). Results showed strong evidence that adults with ASD, compared with typically developing adults, are not differentially affected by acute exposure to violent video games. Moreover, model comparisons provided modest evidence against any effect of violent game content whatsoever. Findings from this experiment suggest that societal concerns that exposure to violent games may have a unique effect on adults with autism are not supported by evidence.},

For Japanese participants, perceived norms about environmental behavior predicted proenvironmental decision making. Facilitating sustainability across nations requires an understanding of how culture determines which psychological factors drive human action.},

The present research examines whether individuals who vary in their socioeconomic status significantly differ in their psychological antecedents of support for pro-environmental action. Study 1, using U.S. nationally representative data, showed that personal beliefs about climate change predicted support for pro-environmental policies more strongly among individuals with a higher, relative to lower, SES background. Studies 2 and 3, by employing correlational and experimental approaches respectively, found that general sense of control over life outcomes underlies the extent to which support for pro-environmental action is contingent on personal beliefs about climate change. Study 4 identified perceived social norms about pro-environmental actions as an alternative predictor of support for pro-environmental action among people from lower SES background. Taken together, the present research shows that individuals with distinct socioeconomic backgrounds differ in their key psychological levers of pro-environmental action. To grasp how to solve urgent social issues such as climate change requires greater understanding of the psychology of citizens with diverse backgrounds.},

Two networks can be computed: a temporal network, in which one investigates if symptoms (or other relevant variables) predict one another over time, and a contemporaneous network, in which one investigates if symptoms predict one another in the same window of measurement. The contemporaneous network is a partial correlation network, which is emerging in the analysis of cross-sectional data but is not yet utilized in the analysis of time series data. We explain the importance of partial correlation networks and exemplify the network structures on time series data of a psychiatric patient.},

  abstract = {Methodological developments and software implementations are progressing at an increasingly fast pace. The introduction and widespread acceptance of preprint archived reports and open-source software have made state-of-the-art statistical methods readily accessible to researchers. At the same time, researchers are increasingly concerned that their results should be reproducible (i.e., the same analysis should yield the same numeric results at a later time), which is a basic requirement for assessing the results' replicability (i.e., whether results at a later time support the same conclusions). Although this age of fast-paced methodology greatly facilitates reproducibility and replicability, it also undermines them in ways not often realized by researchers. This article draws researchers' attention to these threats and proposes guidelines to help minimize their impact. Reproducibility may be influenced by software development and change over time, a problem that is greatly compounded by the rising dependency between software packages. Replicability is affected by rapidly changing standards, researcher degrees of freedom, and possible bugs or errors in code, whether introduced by software developers or empirical researchers implementing an analysis. This article concludes with a list of recommendations to improve the reproducibility and replicability of results.},

However, little is known about how trust can be fostered. One cognitive process that has been suggested as a precursor of trust is perspective-taking, but experimental evidence for a causal relation between the two constructs is missing. In the present article, we investigated whether perspective-taking increases trust in strangers and known interaction partners. Perspective-taking should lead to trust, because it has been shown to increase liking of other people, which itself is an important antecedent of trust. In three high-powered experiments (total N = 612), we investigated the effects of perspective-taking on trust using a novel visuo-spatial manipulation of perspective-taking. In Experiment 1, participants reported feeling more trust for a stranger after engaging in visuo-spatial perspective-taking compared to trials where they remained in their egocentric perspective. Experiment 2 supported the above-mentioned theoretical mechanism that trust in a stranger is increased due to liking and generalized the results from self-reported trust to behavioral trust within a trust game. Experiment 3 demonstrated an important boundary condition of this effect by showing that when the trustworthiness of another person is concurrently directly manipulated by giving participants information about how the other person has behaved in the past, the effects of perspective-taking on behavioral trust vanish, and while its effects on self-reported liking and trust remain intact, they are small in comparison to the effects of direct trustworthiness manipulations on self-reported liking and trust.},

As with other sources of international finance, such as foreign direct investment and foreign aid, worker remittances shape politics in recipient countries. We examine the political consequences of remittances by exploring how they influence antigovernment protest behavior. While recent research argues that remittances have a pernicious effect on politics by contributing to authoritarian stability, we argue the opposite: Remittances increase political protest in nondemocracies by augmenting the resources available to potential political opponents. Using cross-national data on a latent measure of antigovernment political protest, we show that remittances increase protest. To explore the mechanism linking remittances to protest, we turn to individual-level data from eight nondemocracies in Africa to show that remittance receipt increases protest in opposition areas but not in progovernment regions.},

Additionally, loss framing changes how decisions are made: In the domain of losses, trustors and trustees become less calculative \textemdash{} trust decisions involving losses are less sensitive to changes in expected value and reciprocity decisions are less sensitive to the financial temptation to betray trust. Critically, these changes in the process of decision-making are more pronounced when people interact with a human (vs computer) partner, pointing to uniquely social consequences of loss framing.

In four studies (total N = 2086), we investigated preferences for consequentialist vs. non-consequentialist social partners endorsing instrumental harm or impartial beneficence and examined how such preferences varied across different types of social relationships. Our results demonstrate robust preferences for non-consequentialist over consequentialist agents in the domain of instrumental harm, and weaker \textendash{} but still evident \textendash{} preferences in the domain of impartial beneficence. In the domain of instrumental harm, non-consequentialist agents were consistently viewed as more moral and trustworthy, preferred for a range of social roles, and entrusted with more money in economic exchanges. In the domain of impartial beneficence, preferences for non-consequentialist agents were observed for close interpersonal relationships requiring direct interaction (friend, spouse) but not for more distant roles with little-to-no personal interaction (political leader).

Moreover, we address three major methodological limitations of previous research in this area: a lack of an unconstrained control condition; non-compliance with time manipulations leading to high rates of exclusions and thus a selection bias; and non-comprehension of the structure of the game. Even after eliminating participant selection bias and non-comprehension, we find that deliberation decreases cooperation: even in competitive contexts towards out-groups and even in a losses frame, though the differences in cooperation between groups was consistent across conditions.

Humans seamlessly extract and integrate the emotional content delivered by the face and the voice of others. It is however poorly understood how perceptual decisions unfold in time when people discriminate the expression of emotions transmitted using dynamic facial and vocal signals, as in natural social context. In this study, we relied on a gating paradigm to track how the recognition of emotion expressions across the senses unfold over exposure time. We first demonstrate that across all emotions tested, a discriminatory decision is reached earlier with faces than with voices. Importantly, multisensory stimulation consistently reduced the required accumulation of perceptual evidences needed to reach correct discrimination (Isolation Point). We also observed that expressions with different emotional content provide cumulative evidence at different speeds, with ``fear'' being the expression with the fastest isolation point across the senses. Finally, the lack of correlation between the confusion patterns in response to facial and vocal signals across time suggest distinct relations between the discriminative features extracted from the two signals. Altogether, these results provide a comprehensive view on how auditory, visual and audiovisual information related to different emotion expressions accumulate in time, highlighting how multisensory context can fasten the discrimination process when minimal information is available.},

To understand a speaker's intention, one must take the speaker's perspective. Multilingual exposure may promote effective communication by enhancing perspective taking. We tested children on a task that required perspective taking to interpret a speaker's intended meaning. Monolingual children failed to interpret the speaker's meaning dramatically more often than both bilingual children and children who were exposed to a multilingual environment but were not bilingual themselves. Children who were merely exposed to a second language performed as well as bilingual children, despite having lower executive-function scores. Thus, the communicative advantages demonstrated by the bilinguals may be social in origin, and not due to enhanced executive control. For millennia, multilingual exposure has been the norm. Our study shows that such an environment may facilitate the development of perspective-taking tools that are critical for effective communication.},

  abstract = {There is considerable evidence from both vertebrates and invertebrates that persistently active protein kinases maintain changes in synaptic strength that underlie memory. In the hermaphrodite marine mollusk, Aplysia californica, truncated forms of protein kinase C (PKC) termed protein kinase Ms have been implicated in both intermediate- and long-term facilitation, an increase in synaptic strength between sensory neurons and motor neurons thought to underlie behavioural sensitization in the animal. However, few substrates have been identified as candidates that could mediate this increase in synaptic strength. PKMs have been proposed to maintain synaptic strength through preventing endocytosis of AMPA receptors. Numb is a conserved regulator of endocytosis that is modulated by phosphorylation. We have identified and cloned Aplysia Numb (ApNumb). ApNumb contains three conserved PKC phosphorylation sites and PKMs generated from classical and atypical Aplysia PKCs can phosphorylate ApNumb in vitro and in cells. Over-expression of ApNumb that lacks the conserved PKC phosphorylation sites blocks increases in surface levels of a pHluorin-tagged Aplysia glutamate receptor measured using live imaging after intermediate- or long-term facilitation. Over-expression of this form of ApNumb did not block increases in synaptic strength seen during intermediate-term facilitation, but did block increases in synaptic strength seen during long-term facilitation. There was no effect of over-expression of this form of ApNumb on other putative Numb targets as measured using increases in calcium downstream of neurotrophins or agonists of metabotropic glutamate receptors. These results suggest that in Aplysia neurons, Numb specifically regulates AMPA receptor trafficking and is an attractive candidate for a target of PKMs in long-term maintenance of synaptic strength.

We investigated whether this also applies to decision making by examining adult participants' choices between pairs of consumer products that were presented with a third, less desirable ``decoy'' option. Participants' preferences between the items in a given pair frequently switched when the third item in the set was changed, but this tendency was reduced among individuals with ASC, which indicated that their choices were more consistent and conventionally rational than those of control participants. A comparison of people who were drawn from the general population and who varied in their levels of autistic traits revealed a weaker version of the same effect. The reduced context sensitivity was not due to differences in noisy responding, and although the ASC group took longer to make their decisions, this did not account for the enhanced consistency of their choices. The results extend the characterization of autistic cognition as relatively context insensitive to a new domain, and have practical implications for socioeconomic behavior.},

This utilization of subliminal information was flexible and adapted to a change in cues predicting task switches and occurred only when switch trials were difficult and effortful. When cues were consciously visible, participants were unable to discern their relevance and could not use them to enhance switch performance. Our results show that unconscious cognition can implicitly use subliminal information in a goal-directed manner for anticipatory control, and they also suggest that subliminal representations may be more conducive to certain forms of associative learning.},

We predicted that hierarchical minority organizations are perceived as more effective social agents than non-hierarchical minority organizations and thus are particularly unlikely to be supported by those who prefer to maintain inequality. In a pretest, a hierarchical organization was judged more efficacious than a non-hierarchical organization. In two experiments (N=814; N=809), organizational structure (hierarchical vs. non-hierarchical) and membership (baseline vs. minority) were manipulated. Stronger preference for maintaining inequality was associated with increased desire to limit a minority organization's access to power, specifically when that organization was hierarchical. Findings suggest structure may signal the extent to which minority organizations pose a threat to the dominant social order and thus can drive responses to them. That is, minorities who organize may face unique pushback from those invested in maintaining inequality.},

In turn, this behavior was associated with greater satisfaction with the conversation and with the relationship in the following 8-day diary portion of the study. These findings represent a significant step forward in understanding the crucial role of automatic processes in romantic relationships. Together, they provide novel evidence that relationship success appears to be highly dependent on how people spontaneously behave in their relationship, which may be ultimately rooted in their implicit partner evaluations.},

First, we predicted that need for closure would be more strongly related to political identity (symbolic ideology and party identification; Hypothesis 1) and issue positions (operational ideology; Hypothesis 2) among individuals who see their political preferences as more self-central. Then we predicted that the stronger relationship between need for closure and issue positions among individuals high in centrality would be accounted for by stronger relationships between need for closure and political identity and between political identity and issue positions (Hypothesis 3). Data from a nationally representative survey provide evidence for these hypotheses, suggesting that the relationship between epistemic needs and political preferences differs as a function of how self-relevant politics is.},

Whether these commonalities are shaped by potentially universal principles of human information processing has been of central interest in the language and psychological sciences. Research has identified one such abstract property in the domain of word order: Although sentence word-order preferences vary across languages, the superficially different orders result in short grammatical dependencies between words. Because dependencies are easier to process when they are short rather than long, these findings raise the possibility that languages are shaped by biases of human information processing. In the current study, we directly tested the hypothesized causal link. We found that learners exposed to novel miniature artificial languages that had unnecessarily long dependencies did not follow the surface preference of their native language but rather systematically restructured the input to reduce dependency lengths. These results provide direct evidence for a causal link between processing preferences in individual speakers and patterns in linguistic diversity.},

To compare chronic damage and deficits following increasing numbers of repeated mTBIs, a closed-head weight-drop model of repeated mTBI was used to deliver 1, 2 or 3 mTBIs to adult female rats at 24 h intervals. Outcomes were assessed at 3 months following the first mTBI. No gross motor, sensory or reflex deficits were identified (p {$>$} 0.05), consistent with current literature. Cognitive function assessed using a Morris water maze revealed chronic memory deficits following 1 and 2, but not 3 mTBI compared to shams (p {$\leq$} 0.05). Oxidative damage to DNA was assessed immunohistochemically in the dentate hilus of the hippocampus and splenium of the corpus callosum; no changes were observed. IBA1-positive microglia were increased in size in the cortex following 1 mTBI and in the corpus callosum following 2 mTBI compared to shams (p {$\leq$} 0.05); no changes were observed in the dentate hilus. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive astrocyte immunoreactivity was assessed in all three brain regions and no chronic changes were observed. Integrity of myelin ultrastructure in the corpus callosum was assessed using transmission electron microscopy. G ratio was decreased following 2 mTBIs compared to shams (p {$\leq$} 0.05) at post hoc level only. The changing patterns of damage and deficits following increasing numbers of mTBI may reflect dynamic responses to small numbers of mTBIs or a conditioning effect such that increasing numbers of mTBIs do not necessarily result in worsening pathology.

We conducted four experiments with two undergraduate samples from Hong Kong and two American Amazon Mechanical Turk samples (overall N = 1186). We contrasted situations involving either regret or lack of and examined whether these were perceived to be a result of action or inaction. We found consistent evidence for a ``regret-action effect'', that regret was perceived as more likely a result of taking action than of not acting, compared to no-regret. This regret-action effect held for action-inaction inferences drawn from target's regret both before and after the target learned of the outcome of the decision. Regret also affected perceived action-inaction norms, with the no-regret situation construed as having weaker action norms (compared to the regret and control conditions).

Most of the literature to date has focused on sunk costs, yet we offer a new perspective on the classic escalation-of-commitment phenomenon by focusing on the impact of negative feedback. On the basis of the inaction-effect bias, we theorized that negative feedback results in the tendency to take action, regardless of what that action may be. In four experiments, we demonstrated that people facing escalation-decision situations were indeed action oriented and that framing escalation as action and de-escalation as inaction resulted in a stronger tendency to escalate than framing de-escalation as action and escalation as inaction (mini-meta-analysis effect d = 0.37, 95\% confidence interval = [0.21, 0.53]).},

In two experiments, we combined a Pavlovian learning framework with dyadic economic games to test whether blocking mechanisms support value-based social learning in the gain (altruistic dictators) and loss (greedy robbers) domains. Subjects first learned about an altruistic dictator, who subsequently made altruistic splits collectively with a partner. Results revealed that because the presence of the dictator already predicted the outcome, subjects did not learn to associate value with the partner. This social blocking effect was not observed in the loss domain: A kind robber's partner, who could steal all the subjects' money but stole little, acquired highly positive value\textemdash which biased subjects' subsequent behavior. These findings reveal how Pavlovian mechanisms support efficient social learning, while also demonstrating that violations of social expectations can attenuate how readily these mechanisms are recruited.},

Objectives The amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) research community was one of the first to adopt methodology guidelines to improve preclinical research reproducibility. We here present the results of a systematic review to investigate how the standards in this field changed over the 10-year period during which the guidelines were first published (2007) and updated (2010).
Methods We searched for papers reporting ALS research on SOD1 (superoxide dismutase 1) mice published between 2005 and 2015 on the ISI Web of Science database, resulting in a sample of 569 papers to review, after triage. Two scores\textemdash one for methodological quality, one for regulatory compliance\textemdash were built from weighted sums of separate sets of items, and subjected to multivariable regression analysis, to assess how these related to publication year, type of study, country of origin and journal.
Results Reporting standards improved over time. Of papers published after the first ALS guidelines were made public, fewer than 9\% referred specifically to these. Of key research parameters, only three (genetic background, number of transgenes and group size) were reported in {$>$}50\% of the papers. Information on housing conditions, randomisation and blinding was absent in over two-thirds of the papers. Group size was among the best reported parameters, but the majority reported using fewer than the recommended sample size and only two studies clearly justified group size.
Conclusions General methodological standards improved gradually over a period of 8\textendash 10 years, but remained generally comparable with related fields with no specific guidelines, except with regard to severity. Only 11\% of ALS studies were classified in the highest severity level (animals allowed to reach death or moribund stages), substantially below the proportion in studies of comparable neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington's. The existence of field-specific guidelines, although a welcome indication of concern, seems insufficient to ensure adherence to high methodological standards. Other mechanisms may be required to improve methodological and welfare standards.},

  abstract = {Boundaries are crucial to our representation of the geometric shape of scenes, which can be used to reorient in space. Behavioral research has shown that children and adults share exquisite sensitivity to a defining feature of a boundary: its vertical extent. Imaging studies have shown that this boundary property is represented in the parahippocampal place area (PPA) among typically developed (TD) adults. Here, we show that sensitivity to the vertical extent of scene boundaries is impaired at both the behavioral and neural level in people with Williams syndrome (WS), a genetic deficit that results in severely impaired spatial functions. Behavioral reorientation was tested in three boundary conditions: a flat Mat, a 5~cm high Curb, and full Walls. Adults with WS could reorient in a rectangular space defined by Wall boundaries, but not Curb or Mat boundaries. In contrast, TD age-matched controls could reorient by all three boundary types and TD 4-year-olds could reorient by either Wall or Curb boundaries. Using fMRI, we find that the WS behavioral deficit is echoed in their neural representation of boundaries. While TD age-matched controls showed distinct neural responses to scenes depicting Mat, Curb, and Wall boundaries in the PPA, people with WS showed only a distinction between the Wall and Mat or Curb, but no distinction between the Mat and Curb. Taken together, these results reveal a close coupling between the representation of boundaries as they are used in behavioral reorientation and neural encoding, suggesting that damage to this key element of spatial representation may have a genetic foundation.},

We predicted and found that providers who received a goal conflict (vs. complementary) message perceived greater conflict, and rated palliative goals as less important. Providers who received a goal conflict (vs. complementarity) message also rated curative goals as less important. Moreover, there was an indirect link from goal conflict condition to willingness to provide palliative care, mediated by perceived goal conflict. A self-affirmation manipulation reduced providers' willingness to provide palliative care, but did not influence the effect of goal conflict on decision-making. Findings suggest that goal conflict is consequential for high-stakes decisions made for others, and that goal conflict (vs. complementarity) lowers importance of, and increases disengagement from, conflicting goals.},

The optimal level of credulity depends on the relative costs of believing misinformation and failing to attend to accurate information. When information concerns hazards, erroneous incredulity is often more costly than erroneous credulity, given that disregarding accurate warnings is more harmful than adopting unnecessary precautions. Because no equivalent asymmetry exists for information concerning benefits, people should generally be more credulous of hazard information than of benefit information. This adaptive negatively biased credulity is linked to negativity bias in general and is more prominent among people who believe the world to be more dangerous. Because both threat sensitivity and beliefs about the dangerousness of the world differ between conservatives and liberals, we predicted that conservatism would positively correlate with negatively biased credulity. Two online studies of Americans supported this prediction, potentially illuminating how politicians' alarmist claims affect different portions of the electorate.},

These scenarios may be popular because people have their own beliefs and visions about the apocalypse and the need to prepare. The prevalence of such beliefs might also hold societal relevance and serve as a type of projective test of personality. However, there are no quantitative accounts of post-apocalyptic or prepping beliefs. As such, we conducted seven studies (Ntotal = 1034) to do so. In Studies 1 and 2, we developed a post-apocalyptic and prepping beliefs scale, explored its correlates, and confirmed its structure and psychometric properties. In Study 3, we attempted to activate a `prepper' mindset and further explore the correlates of the new scale. In Studies 4 and 5, we investigated covariations in daily feelings, thoughts, and events, and prepping beliefs. In Studies 6a and 6b, we compared scores from `real' preppers and to a non-prepping group. Overall, we found that post-apocalyptic concerns and prepping beliefs are predictive of low agreeableness and humility, paranoia, cynicism, conspiracy mentality, conservatism, and social dominance orientation. We also found that increased belief in the need to prep is associated with God-belief, negative daily experiences, and global political events. \textcopyright{} 2019 European Association of Personality Psychology},

Electroencephalographic recordings (CSD estimate), revealed the sequence of cortical activities that lead, or not, to conscious detection. Besides medio-prefrontal activities related to action monitoring and error detection, the motor command sent by the primary motor cortices also differed between detected and undetected partial errors: while it develops identically, it is stopped earlier for the latter than for the former, suggesting a critical role in partial error detection. Second, the analysis of the ``Error positivity'' \textendash{} Pe, classically linked to error awareness, confirmed its absence just after partial errors, be they detected or not. However, a Pe occurs after the corrective response of partial errors that were detected, suggesting that we become aware of our partial errors only after their correction.

  abstract = {Abstract Neuroinflammation is a common pathological correlate of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) in individuals on antiretroviral therapy (ART). Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) regulates neuroinflammation, clears extracellular Amyloid (A)-?, surveys for damaged neurons, and orchestrates microglial differentiation. TREM2 has not been studied in HIV+ brain tissues. In this retrospective study, we investigated TREM2 expression levels and localization to microglia, A? protein levels, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-{$\alpha$} transcript levels in the frontal cortices of 52 HIV+ decedents. All donors had been on ART; 14 were cognitively normal (CN), 17 had an asymptomatic neurocognitive impairment (ANI), and 21 had a minor neurocognitive disorder (MND). Total TREM2 protein levels were increased in the soluble and decreased in the membrane-enriched fractions of MND brain tissues compared to CN; however, brains from MND Hispanics showed the most robust alterations in TREM2 as well as significantly increased TNF-{$\alpha$} mRNA and A? levels when compared to CN Hispanics. Significant alterations in the expression of total TREM2 protein and transcripts for TNF-{$\alpha$} were not observed in non-Hispanics, despite higher levels of A? in the non-Hispanic CN group compared to the non-Hispanic MND groups. These findings show that decreased and increased TREM2 in membrane-bound fractions and in soluble-enriched fractions, respectively, is associated with increased A? and neuroinflammation in this cohort of HIV+ brains, particularly those identifying as Hispanics. These findings suggest a role for TREM2 in the brain of HIV+ individuals may deserve more investigation as a biomarker for HAND and as a possible therapeutic target.

However, there is variability across subjects in the extent to which stimulation modulates behaviour, providing a challenge for the development of applications. Here, we employed an individual differences approach to test if baseline concentrations of the neurochemicals GABA and glutamate are associated with an individual's response to transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). Using a previously replicated response selection training paradigm, we applied tDCS to the left prefrontal cortex part-way through the learning of a six-alternative-forced-choice task. Across three sessions, subjects received anodal, cathodal, or sham stimulation. Pre-tDCS baseline measures of GABA and glutamate, acquired using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), correlated with the extent to which stimulation modulated behaviour. Specifically, relative concentrations of GABA and glutamate (used as an index of neurochemical excitability) in the prefrontal cortex were associated with the degree to which active stimulation disrupted response selection training. This work represents an important step forward in developing models to predict stimulation efficacy, and provides a unique insight into how trait-based properties of the targeted cortex interact with stimulation.},

  abstract = {One of the mind's most fundamental tasks is interpreting incoming data and weighing the value of new evidence. Across a wide variety of contexts, we show that when summarizing evidence, people exhibit a binary bias: a tendency to impose categorical distinctions on continuous data. Evidence is compressed into discrete bins, and the difference between categories forms the summary judgment. The binary bias distorts belief formation\textemdash such that when people aggregate conflicting scientific reports, they attend to valence and inaccurately weight the extremity of the evidence. The same effect occurs when people interpret popular forms of data visualization, and it cannot be explained by other statistical features of the stimuli. This effect is not confined to explicit statistical estimates; it also influences how people use data to make health, financial, and public-policy decisions. These studies (N = 1,851) support a new framework for understanding information integration across a wide variety of contexts.},

Counter to this intuitive view, we showed in the present research that the motor system also contributes to judgments of perceptual confidence. In two experiments, we used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to manipulate response-specific representations in the premotor cortex, selectively disrupting postresponse confidence in visual discrimination judgments. Specifically, stimulation of the motor representation associated with the unchosen response reduced confidence in correct responses, thereby reducing metacognitive capacity without changing visual discrimination performance. Effects of TMS on confidence were observed when stimulation was applied both before and after the response occurred, which suggests that confidence depends on late-stage metacognitive processes. These results place constraints on models of perceptual confidence and metacognition by revealing that action-specific information in the premotor cortex contributes to perceptual confidence.},

Yet the individual links of this psychological chain have only been examined cross-sectionally, and never together. This article employs original longitudinal survey data to simultaneously assess changes in ingroup identification, outgroup aversion, and national identification over the election period within one diverse society: Romania. While ingroup identification does increase, ethnic relations do not worsen. On the contrary, outgroup aversion decreases while national identification increases, for minority and majority Romanian citizens alike. I explain these findings with the common ingroup identity model from social psychology: Elections in ethnically diverse societies may not only increase the salience of ethnic groups but also that of the superordinate, national identity. The findings question the often assumed automaticity of intergroup threat.},

The current study addressed the effect of training on ERP components related to and independent of attentional feature selection. Participants learned to categorize cartoon animals over six training sessions (8,800 trials) after which ERPs were recorded during a target detection task performed on trained and untrained stimulus sets. The onset of the selection negativity, an ERP component indexing attentional modulation, was about 60~msec earlier for trained than untrained stimuli. Trained stimuli also elicited centro-parietal N200 and N320 components that were insensitive to attentional feature selection. The scalp distribution and timecourse of these components were better matched by studies of orthography than object expertise. Source localization using eLORETA suggested that the strongest neural sources of the selection negativity were in right ventral temporal cortex whereas the strongest sources of the N200/N320 components were in left ventral temporal cortex, again consistent with the hypothesis that training recruited orthography related areas. Overall, training altered neural processes related to attentional selection, but also affected neural processes that were independent of feature selection.},

  abstract = {Ischemic stroke is one of the most important causes of death and disability worldwide. Subroutines underlying cell death after stroke are largely unknown despite their importance in the design of novel therapies for this pathology. Necroptosis, a recently described form of regulated cell death, has been related with inflammation and, in some models, with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. We hypothesize that alleviation of ER stress following a salubrinal treatment will reduce the ischemic-dependent necroptosis. To probe the hypothesis, we measured, at 48 and 72 h after transient global cerebral ischemia in rat, in cerebral cortex and cornu ammonis 1, the main hallmarks of necroptosis: mRNA levels and phosphorylation of mixed lineage kinase domain like pseudokinase as well as receptor interacting serine/threonine protein kinase 3, along the years 2017\textendash 2018. Selective neuronal loss after 7 days of the ischemic insult, and other markers related with the inflammatory response were also measured. This study shows that necroptosis in cerebral cortex can be detected after 72 h of the insult and seems to be elicited before 48 h of reperfusion. The type of necroptosis here observed seems to be tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 independent. Necroptotic response is less evident in the cornu ammonis 1 hippocampal area than in cerebral cortex. The treatment with salubrinal administered 1 and 24 h after the ischemia, decreased the necroptotic marker levels and reduced the areas of selective neuronal loss, supporting the presence of ischemic-dependent necroptosis, and the notion that ER stress is involved in the necroptotic response.

  abstract = {It is well-known that the extracellular concentration of calcium affects neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission. Less is known about the physiological concentration of extracellular calcium in the brain. In electrophysiological brain slice experiments, the artificial cerebrospinal fluid traditionally contains relatively high concentrations of calcium (2-4 mM) to support synaptic transmission and suppress neuronal excitability. Using an ion-selective electrode, we determined the fraction of ionized calcium in healthy human cerebrospinal fluid to 1.0 mM of a total concentration of 1.2 mM (86\%). Using patch-clamp and extracellular recordings in the CA1 region in acute slices of rat hippocampus, we then compared the effects of this physiological concentration of calcium with the commonly used 2 mM on neuronal excitability, synaptic transmission, and long-term potentiation (LTP) to examine the magnitude of changes in this range of extracellular calcium. Increasing the total extracellular calcium concentration from 1.2 to 2 mM decreased spontaneous action potential firing, induced a depolarization of the threshold, and increased the rate of both de- and repolarization of the action potential. Evoked synaptic transmission was approximately doubled, with a balanced effect between inhibition and excitation. In 1.2 mM calcium high-frequency stimulation did not result in any LTP, whereas a prominent LTP was observed at 2 or 4 mM calcium. Surprisingly, this inability to induce LTP persisted during blockade of GABAergic inhibition. In conclusion, an increase from the physiological 1.2 mM to 2 mM calcium in the artificial cerebrospinal fluid has striking effects on neuronal excitability, synaptic transmission, and the induction of LTP.

This intervention is based on the premise that unintentional bias is like a habit that can be broken with sufficient motivation, awareness, and effort. We conducted replication of the original habit-breaking intervention experiment in a sample more than three times the size of the original (N=292). We also measured all outcomes every other day for 14days and measured potential mechanisms for the intervention's effects. Consistent with previous results, the habit-breaking intervention produced a change in concern that endured two weeks post-intervention. These effects were associated with increased sensitivity to the biases of others and an increased tendency to label biases as wrong. Contrasting with the original work, both control and intervention participants decreased in implicit bias, and the effects of the habit-breaking intervention on awareness declined in the second week of the study. In a subsample recruited two years later, intervention participants were more likely than control participants to object on a public online forum to an essay endorsing racial stereotyping. Our results suggest that the habit-breaking intervention produces enduring changes in peoples' knowledge of and beliefs about race-related issues, and we argue that these changes are even more important for promoting long-term behavioral change than are changes in implicit bias.},

Here, we adapted the inattentional-blindness paradigm to test whether olfactory awareness is dependent on attention. Across three experiments, participants performed a visual search task with either a high or low perceptual load (a well-established attentional manipulation) while exposed to an ambient coffee aroma. Consistent with our hypothesis, results showed that task load modulated olfactory awareness: 42.5\% fewer participants in the high- than in the low-load condition reported noticing the coffee aroma. Our final experiment demonstrates that because of unique characteristics of olfactory habituation, the consequences of inattentional anosmia can persist even once attention becomes available. These findings establish the phenomenon of inattentional anosmia and have applied implications for predicting when people may miss potentially important olfactory information.},

  abstract = {Legislatures differ in their institutional capacity to draft and enact policy. While strong legislatures can increase the congruence of policy outcomes to the electorate's preferences, they can also inject uncertainty into markets with their ability to alter the political economic landscape. We argue that this uncertainty will manifest in a state's ability to borrow and hypothesize a negative relationship between legislative capacity and creditworthiness. Using ratings of general obligation bonds issued by the American states over nearly two decades and data on the institutional capacity of state legislative assemblies, we find support for the claim that having a legislature that is better equipped to affect policy change increases credit risk evaluations. The results we present broaden our understanding of the importance of legislative institutions, the determinants of credit risk, and the economic implications of democratic responsiveness.},

A growing body of evidence suggests that rhythmic neural activity in the alpha frequency band (8\textendash 12 Hz) tracks the spatial locus of covert attention, which suggests that alpha activity is integral to spatial attention. However, extant work has not provided a compelling test of another key prediction: that alpha activity tracks the temporal dynamics of covert spatial orienting. In the current study, we examined the time course of spatially specific alpha activity after central cues and during visual search. Critically, the time course of this activity tracked trial-by-trial variations in orienting latency during visual search. These findings provide important new evidence for the link between rhythmic brain activity and covert spatial attention, and they highlight a powerful approach for tracking the spatial and temporal dynamics of this core cognitive process.},

We hypothesized that observers would attribute lower human characteristics to outgroup bullies when bullies inflict harm on an ingroup victim.

In this study, we investigated the relationship between obsessive-compulsive (OC) symptoms and the SoA over thoughts. Participants were told that subliminal auditory primes (actually sham) can insert thoughts into their minds, and their experiences of inserted thoughts were collected online. The results of three experiments showed reduced SoA over thoughts in individuals with subclinical OC symptoms, regardless of the valence of the thoughts. Several potential confounding factors (e.g., suppression, vigilance, general anxiety) were ruled out. The experience of inserted thoughts was related to experiencing thoughts as ``out of context,'' which partially explained reduced SoA in participants with high levels of OC symptoms. These experiments highlight the importance of focusing on the low-level, contextual, and phenomenological characteristics of intrusive thoughts in addition to their content and appraisals.},

These patterns may be a result of marked dietary differences between captive and wild settings and associated impacts on the gut microbiome. However, given that most existing studies target NHP dietary specialists, it is unclear if captive environments have distinct impacts on the gut microbiome of NHPs with different dietary niches. To begin to examine this question, we used 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicon sequences to compare the gut microbiomes of five NHP genera categorized either as folivores (Alouatta, Colobus) or non-folivores (Cercopithecus, Gorilla, Pan) sampled both in captivity and in the wild. Though captivity affected the gut microbiomes of all NHPs in this study, the effects were largest in folivorous NHPs. Shifts in gut microbial diversity and in the relative abundances of fiber-degrading microbial taxa suggest that these findings are driven by marked dietary shifts for folivorous NHPs in captive settings. We propose that zoos and other captive care institutions consider including more natural browse in folivorous NHP diets and regularly bank fecal samples to further explore the relationship between NHP diet, the gut microbiome, and health outcomes.},

  abstract = {Hibernation is a seasonal phenomenon characterized by a drop in metabolic rate and body temperature. Adenosine A1 receptor agonists promote hibernation in different mammalian species, and the understanding of the mechanism inducing hibernation will inform clinical strategies to manipulate metabolic demand that are fundamental to conditions such as obesity, metabolic syndrome, and therapeutic hypothermia. Adenosine A1 receptor agonist-induced hibernation in Arctic ground squirrels is regulated by an endogenous circannual (seasonal) rhythm. This study aims to identify the neuronal mechanism underlying the seasonal difference in response to the adenosine A1 receptor agonist. Arctic ground squirrels were implanted with body temperature transmitters and housed at constant ambient temperature (2\textdegree C) and light cycle (4L:20D). We administered CHA (N6-cyclohexyladenosine), an adenosine A1 receptor agonist in euthermic-summer phenotype and euthermic-winter phenotype and used cFos and phenotypic immunoreactivity to identify cell groups affected by season and treatment. We observed lower core and subcutaneous temperature in winter animals and CHA produced a hibernation-like response in winter, but not in summer. cFos-ir was greater in the median preoptic nucleus and the raphe pallidus in summer after CHA. CHA administration also resulted in enhanced cFos-ir in the nucleus tractus solitarius and decreased cFos-ir in the tuberomammillary nucleus in both seasons. In winter, cFos-ir was greater in the supraoptic nucleus and lower in the raphe pallidus than in summer. The seasonal decrease in the thermogenic response to CHA and the seasonal increase in vasoconstriction, assessed by subcutaneous temperature, reflect the endogenous seasonal modulation of the thermoregulatory systems necessary for CHA-induced hibernation.

Across both studies, in a game with a storyline that included both male and female scientists, the vast majority of students who used gendered pronouns assumed that non-gendered scientist characters were men. In Study 1, playing the Intervention version of the game had no effect on college students' explicit or implicit attitudes toward women in science. In Study 2, there was a positive effect of the Intervention condition on implicit attitudes: participants in the Intervention condition were less likely to describe a female professor as a man than were participants in the Control condition.

Prior           studies predominantly used (a) small samples with low power for precise estimation, (b)           nonclinical samples, and (c) single samples.

Many scholars believe the answer to this question is that heuristics, biases, and ignorance cause voters to misperceive risk magnitudes. By contrast, this article argues that Americans' risk priorities primarily reflect judgments about the extent to which some victims deserve more protection than others and the degree to which it is appropriate for government to intervene in different areas of social life. The article supports this argument with evidence drawn from a survey with 3,000 respondents, using pairwise comparisons to elicit novel measures of how respondents perceive nine dimensions of 100 life-threatening risks. Respondents were well informed about these risks' relative magnitudes\textemdash the correlation between perceived and actual mortality was .82\textemdash but those perceptions explained relatively little variation in policy preferences relative to judgments about the status of victims and the appropriate role of government. These findings hold regardless of political party, education, and other demographics. The article thus argues that the key to understanding Americans' divergent reactions to risk lies more with their values than with their grasp of factual information.},

  abstract = {Recent research has suggested that sequential changes in the prospect of performance-contingent rewards may influence the balance between cognitive flexibility and stability: whereas constant high reward prospect seems to promote cognitive stability, increasing reward prospect has been shown to promote flexible behaviour in voluntary task-switching paradigms. Previous studies, however, confounded cognitive flexibility regarding voluntary task choices with control processes during task execution. We present five experiments to dissociate these two processes by means of a double registration procedure, in which task choice is registered prior to task execution. The data yielded clear evidence for reward-driven modulation of the flexibility-stability balance already at the level of task choices, with higher voluntary switch rates when reward prospect increased compared with situations in which reward prospect remained high. This effect was further modulated by the specific type of registration procedure, suggesting that only deliberate task choices are affected by the reward sequence. These results thus confirm that the prospect of performance-contingent reward can indeed promote either cognitive stability or flexibility depending on the immediate reward history.},

  abstract = {The framing effect refers to the phenomenon that phrasing the same outcomes as gains or losses leads to different risky choices. Most of the framing literature is based on descriptive scenarios, whereas people in real life must make decisions from experience because they rarely receive precise descriptions. However, whether and how framing effects occur in experience-based decisions remain important open questions. In three experiments, we demonstrate that the framing effect is less pronounced in experience-than in description-based decisions. We explain this finding on the basis of affective forecasting with losses. In descriptive conditions, individuals overestimate the impact of potential losses on their emotional reactions, whereas experience helps people become aware of their ability to rationalize losses and mitigates this erroneous affective forecasting, thereby reducing the propensity for risk seeking. Our results offer insight into the specific role of experience in framing effect: experience adjusts affective forecasting with losses, which reduces the framing effect.},

Importantly, however, participants were not more likely to prefer certain advice: They did not dislike advisors who expressed uncertainty by providing ranges of outcomes, giving numerical probabilities, or saying that one event is ``more likely'' than another. Additionally, when faced with an explicit choice, participants were more likely to choose an advisor who provided uncertain advice over an advisor who provided certain advice. Our findings suggest that people do not inherently dislike uncertain advice. Advisors benefit from expressing themselves with confidence, but not from communicating false certainty.},

Rather than boosting status, many anger expressions predictably diminish status. We find that the intensity of expressed anger profoundly influences social perceptions and status conferral. Compared to mildly or moderately angry individuals, extremely angry people are perceived to be less competent and warm, and are thus accorded less status. We also contrast expressions of anger with expressions of sadness across different levels of intensity. At low levels of intensity anger expressions boost status conferral compared to sadness expressions and a neutral control condition, but at high levels of intensity anger expressions harm status conferral compared to sadness expressions and a neutral control condition. Taken together, our findings reveal that the relationship between expressed emotion and status is far more nuanced than prior work has assumed, and that the magnitude of an emotion can substantively moderate its effects.},

We argue that through time and in different periods of occupation - Middle Palaeolithic, Iron Age, Late Medieval, and Modern - the valley's residents have met similar challenges of extreme geography and a harsh environment differently, in particular by interacting in different ways and at different levels of intensity with the outside world.  These shifts caused changes in population, settlement, and socio-political organisation that are reflected strongly in the local landscape and built environment.  Population, settlement, and socio-political organisation did not hold constant, but were influenced by external forces, despite the seeming isolation of the valley and its occupants. This article demonstrates how thin material and documentary records can be greatly enhanced through carefully integrated, interdisciplinary studies of settlement, home construction, and neighbourhood expansion and abandonment.  We present select results drawn from an on-line database and GIS, along with photos, drawings, and audio recordings of transcribed interviews.  An interactive system of blogs allows the authors to direct readers to additional sources of data, and readers to tell authors and other readers how they have accessed and displayed these data, and with what results.},

  abstract = {The degree to which classical liberal, individualist principles of Western societies are seen as (in)compatible with multiculturalism and minority rights is a key issue in diverse societies. Classical liberalism is grounded in individual justice principles, suggesting that individuals are responsible for their own fate and should be treated according to their personal characteristics, regardless of group membership. Multiculturalism, in turn, is grounded in collective justice principles, recognizing cultural differences and seeking greater equality between groups. The present research investigates how asymmetric group membership in dominant and subordinate groups shapes perceived compatibility between classical liberalism and multiculturalism. A correlational study (N = 141) first shows that cultural minorities perceive greater compatibility between the two justice principles compared to native majorities. A second (N = 202) and third (N = 164) experimental study involving the description of a fictitious society manipulated perspective-taking as a function of social status, cultural origin and numerical size of groups. The findings show that respondents taking the perspective of immigrant groups perceive greater compatibility between classical liberalism and multiculturalism as an abstract ideology compared to a native perspective, and that a low status perspective leads to greater compatibility between classical liberalism and multiculturalism as a concrete policy compared to a high status perspective. Overall, these studies suggest that membership in subordinate groups generally increases perceived compatibility between individual and collective forms of justice. Implications associated with growing civic integrationist policies in Europe are discussed.},

  abstract = {Abstract The amyloid aggregation of the presynaptic protein {$\alpha$}-synuclein (AS) is pathognomonic of Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders. Physiologically, AS contributes to synaptic homeostasis by participating in vesicle maintenance, trafficking, and release. Its avidity for highly curved acidic membranes has been related to the distinct chemistry of the N-terminal amphipathic helix adopted upon binding to appropriated lipid interfaces. Pathologically, AS populate a myriad of toxic aggregates ranging from soluble oligomers to insoluble amyloid fibrils. Different gain-of-toxic function mechanisms are linked to prefibrillar oligomers which are considered as the most neurotoxic species. Here, we investigated if amyloid oligomerization could hamper AS function as a membrane curvature sensor. We used fluorescence correlation spectroscopy to quantitatively evaluate the interaction of oligomeric species, produced using a popular method based on lyophilization and rehydration, to lipid vesicles of different curvatures and compositions. We found that AS oligomerization has a profound impact on protein-lipid interaction, altering binding affinity and/or curvature sensitivity depending on membrane composition. Our work provides novel insights into how the formation of prefibrillar intermediate species could contribute to neurodegeneration due to a loss-of-function mechanism.

A survey experiment in Malaysia finds that opposition voters overwhelmingly express pretreatment support for the opposition coalition. But when exposed to a treatment vignette about which member party might lead the next government, many voters retract their support. Specifically, voters' support for the coalition declines when their least preferred member is expected to control the government and when they can vote for a closer ideological alternative outside of the coalition. Although voters are committed to opposition unity and democratic transition, that commitment is sensitive to the anticipated consequences of an opposition victory.},

  abstract = {The caudal part of the striatum, also named the tail of the striatum (TS), defines a fourth striatal domain. Determining whether rewarding, aversive and salient stimuli regulate the activity of striatal spiny projections neurons (SPNs) of the TS is therefore of paramount importance to understand its functions, which remain largely elusive. Taking advantage of genetically encoded biosensors (A-kinase activity reporter 3) to record protein kinase A signals and by analyzing the distribution of dopamine D1R- and D2R-SPNs in the TS, we characterized three subterritories: a D2R/A2aR-lacking, a D1R/D2R-intermingled and a D1R/D2R-SPNs-enriched area (corresponding to the amygdalostriatal transition). In addition, we provide evidence that the distribution of D1R- and D2R-SPNs in the TS is evolutionarily conserved (mouse, rat, gerbil). The in vivo analysis of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation in these TS subterritories in response to distinct appetitive, aversive and pharmacological stimuli revealed that SPNs of the TS are not recruited by stimuli triggering innate aversive responses, fasting, satiety, or palatable signals whereas a reduction in ERK phosphorylation occurred following learned avoidance. In contrast, D1R-SPNs of the intermingled and D2R/A2aR-lacking areas were strongly activated by both D1R agonists and psychostimulant drugs (d-amphetamine, cocaine, 3,4-methyl enedioxy methamphetamine, or methylphenidate), but not by hallucinogens. Finally, a similar pattern of ERK activation was observed by blocking selectively dopamine reuptake. Together, our results reveal that the caudal TS might participate in the processing of specific reward signals and discrete aversive stimuli. Cover Image for this issue: doi: 10.1111/jnc.14526.

  abstract = {When pantomiming the use of tools, patients with limb apraxia after left hemisphere stroke (LCVA) produce more spatiotemporal hand action errors with tools associated with conflicting actions for use versus grasp-to-pick-up (e.g., corkscrew) than tools having a single action for both use and grasp (e.g., hammer). There are two possible accounts for this pattern of results. Reduced performance with `conflict' tools may simply reflect weakened automaticity of use action activation, which is evident only when the use and grasp actions are not redundant. Alternatively, poor use performance may reflect a reduced ability of appropriate tool use actions to compete with task-inappropriate action representations. To address this issue, we developed a Stroop-like experiment in which 21 LCVA and 8 neurotypical participants performed pantomime actions in blocks containing two tools that were similar (``neighbors'') in terms of hand action or function, or were unrelated on either dimension. In a congruent condition, they pantomimed the use action associated with the visually presented tool, whereas in an incongruent condition, they pantomimed the use action for the other tool in the block. Relative to controls and other task conditions, LCVA participants showed reductions in hand action errors in incongruent relative to congruent action trials; furthermore, the degree of reduction in this incongruence effect was related to the participants' susceptibility to grasp-on-use conflict in a separate test of pantomime to the sight of tools. Support vector regression lesion-symptom mapping analyses identified the left inferior frontal gyrus, supramarginal gyrus, and superior longitudinal fasciculus as core neuroanatomical sites associated with abnormal performance. Collectively, the results indicate that weakened activation of tool use actions in limb apraxia gives rise to reduced ability of these actions to compete for task-appropriate selection when competition arises within single tools (grasp-on-use conflict) as well as between two tools (reduced neighborhood effects).},

  abstract = {After collective traumas such as natural disasters and terrorist attacks, members of concerned communities experience intense emotions and talk profusely about them. Although these exchanges resemble simple emotional venting, Durkheim's theory of collective effervescence postulates that these collective emotions lead to higher levels of solidarity in the affected community. We present the first large-scale test of this theory through the analysis of digital traces of 62,114 Twitter users after the Paris terrorist attacks of November 2015. We found a collective negative emotional response followed by a marked long-term increase in the use of lexical indicators related to solidarity. Expressions of social processes, prosocial behavior, and positive affect were higher in the months after the attacks for the individuals who participated to a higher degree in the collective emotion. Our findings support the conclusion that collective emotions after a disaster are associated with higher solidarity, revealing the social resilience of a community.},

  abstract = {The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed. [DSM\textendash 5]; American Psychiatric Association, 2013) Section III Alternative Model for Personality Disorders (AMPD) represents a novel approach to the diagnosis of personality disorder (PD). In this model, PD diagnosis requires evaluation of level of impairment in personality functioning (Criterion A) and characterization by pathological traits (Criterion B). Questions about clinical utility, complexity, and difficulty in learning and using the AMPD have been expressed in recent scholarly literature. We examined the learnability, interrater reliability, and clinical utility of the AMPD using a vignette methodology and graduate student raters. Results showed that student clinicians can learn Criterion A of the AMPD to a high level of interrater reliability and agreement with expert ratings. Interrater reliability of the 25 trait facets of the AMPD varied but showed overall acceptable levels of agreement. Examination of severity indexes of PD impairment showed the level of personality functioning (LPF) added information beyond that of global assessment of functioning (GAF). Clinical utility ratings were generally strong. The satisfactory interrater reliability of components of the AMPD indicates the model, including the LPF, is very learnable.},

  abstract = {Previous studies have indicated the potential of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) {$\alpha$}-synuclein ({$\alpha$}-syn) to be an additional biomarker for improving differential diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We evaluated {$\alpha$}-syn diagnostic performance across a well-characterized patient cohort with long-term follow-up. For this purpose, CSF {$\alpha$}-syn levels were determined in 25 subjects diagnosed with stable mild cognitive impairment (stable MCI; n = 25), 27 MCI cases due to AD (MCI-AD; n = 32), 24 MCI cases due to Lewy body disease (MCI-LBD; n = 24) and control subjects (Ctrl; n = 18). CSF {$\alpha$}-syn levels discriminate between the four groups. There were higher {$\alpha$}-syn levels in MCI-AD patients and lower levels in MCI-LBD patients. The combination of {$\alpha$}-syn and P-tau resulted in a specificity of 99\% and a sensitivity of 97\% for MCI-AD. MCI-AD patients with early psychotic symptoms (n = 9) displayed a trend towards a decrease in P-tau and {$\alpha$}-syn compared to the MCI-AD patients without psychotic symptoms (n = 23). We conclude that adding CSF {$\alpha$}-syn to central core AD biomarkers improves an early differential diagnosis of MCI-AD from other forms of MCI.

Despite the importance of blindsight in the study of consciousness, little is known about the nature of patients' experience in their hemianopic field. To address this knowledge gap, we measured blindsight, and assessed the perceptual experience in the contralesional visual field, of seventeen homonymous hemianopic (HH) patients. To ensure that the stimuli were shown in a ``blind'' sector of the visual field, we selected a subgroup of eight complete-HH patients, as determined by automatic perimetry. Firstly, we measured blindsight through a forced-choice task in which the patients had to identify letters displayed on a screen. Secondly, we compared the patients' binary responses (``Something was presented'' vs ``Nothing was presented'') to responses on a new, five-level scale, the Sensation Awareness Scale (SAS), which we designed to include visual as well as non-visual answers (e.g., ``I felt something''). Interestingly, only one of the eight complete-HH patients met the criteria for blindsight. More importantly, our SAS enabled us to identify a previously unreported dissociation, which we have named blindsense, in four of the eight complete-HH patients. Specifically, these four patients exhibited better-than-chance sensitivity to the presence of a stimulus on the subjective scale, despite being unable to identify the stimulus during the forced-choice task. Our findings highlight the importance of awareness-assessment methods to investigate perceptual experiences in the contralesional visual field and suggest a low incidence of blindsight in post-stroke HH patients.},

Background Commonly used strategies for cell delivery to the heart are intramyocardial injection and intracoronary (IC) infusion, both having their advantages and disadvantages. Therefore, alternative strategies, such as retrograde coronary venous infusion (RCVI), are explored. The aim of this confirmatory study was to compare cardiac cell retention between RCVI and IC infusion. As a secondary end point, the procedural safety of RCVI is assessed.
Methods Four weeks after myocardial infarction, 12 pigs were randomised to receive mesenchymal stromal cells, labelled with Indium-111, via RCVI (n=6) or IC infusion (n=6). Four hours after cell administration, nuclear imaging was performed to determine the number of cells retained in the heart both in vivo and ex vivo. Procedure-related safety measures were reported.
Results Cardiac cell retention is significantly lower after RCVI compared with IC infusion (in vivo: RCVI: median 2.89\% vs IC: median 13.74\%, p=0.002, ex vivo: RCVI: median 2.55\% vs IC: median 39.40\%, p=0.002). RCVI led to development of pericardial fluid and haematomas on the frontal wall of the heart in three cases. Coronary venous dissection after RCVI was seen in three pigs, of which one also developed pericardial fluid and a haematoma. IC infusion led to no flow in one pig.
Conclusion RCVI is significantly less efficient in delivering cells to the heart compared with IC infusion. RCVI led to more procedure-related safety issues than IC infusion, with multiple cases of venous dissection and development of haematomas and pericardial fluid collections.},

To test competing predictions derived from these theories, five experiments used the CNI model to investigate whether power affects responses to moral dilemmas by influencing (1) sensitivity to morally relevant consequences, (2) sensitivity to moral norms, or (3) general action tendencies regardless of consequences and norms. Results showed that recalling a personal experience involving high (vs. low) power decreased sensitivity to moral norms (Experiments 1a, 1b, 3). Being assigned to a social role involving high (vs. low) power had inconsistent effects across studies (Experiments 2a, 2b, 3), showing increased sensitivity to moral norms in an integrative data analysis. The findings support calls for more nuanced theoretical accounts that specify how psychological and structural aspects of power differentially influence behavior.},

Although this principle seems straightforward in a lab setting, it poses a problem in naturalistic viewing: Two objects that have the same size on the retina will differ in real-world size if one is nearby and the other is far away. Using the Ponzo illusion to manipulate perceived size while keeping retinal size constant, we demonstrated across 71 participants that visual objects attract attention when their perceived size matches a memory template, compared with mismatching objects that have the same size on the retina. This shows that memory templates affect visual selection after object representations are modulated by scene context, thus providing a working mechanism for template-based search in naturalistic vision.},

A combination of Bayes analyses and standard regressions revealed that the age at which the children had the conceptual insight that number words represent specific quantities (cardinal value) was strongly related to their later number-system knowledge and was more consistently related to broader mathematics than to reading achievement, controlling for intelligence, executive function, and parental education levels. The key implication is that it is not simply knowledge of cardinal value but the age of acquisition of this principle that is central to later mathematical development and school readiness.},

However, this ``ego-quieting'' effect contradicts an apparent psychological universal, the self-centrality principle. According to this principle, practicing any skill renders that skill self-central, and self-centrality breeds self-enhancement bias. We examined those opposing predictions in the first tests of mind-body practices' self-enhancement effects. In Experiment 1, we followed 93 yoga students over 15 weeks, assessing self-centrality and self-enhancement bias after yoga practice (yoga condition, n = 246) and without practice (control condition, n = 231). In Experiment 2, we followed 162 meditators over 4 weeks (meditation condition: n = 246; control condition: n = 245). Self-enhancement bias was higher in the yoga (Experiment 1) and meditation (Experiment 2) conditions, and those effects were mediated by greater self-centrality. Additionally, greater self-enhancement bias mediated mind-body practices' well-being benefits. Evidently, neither yoga nor meditation fully quiet the ego; to the contrary, they boost self-enhancement.},

  abstract = {Cognitive performance varies widely between individuals and is highly influenced by structural and functional properties of the brain. In the past, neuroscientific research was principally concerned with fluid intelligence, while neglecting its equally important counterpart crystallized intelligence. Crystallized intelligence is defined as the depth and breadth of knowledge and skills that are valued by one's culture. The accumulation of crystallized intelligence is guided by information storage capacities and is likely to be reflected in an individual's level of general knowledge. In spite of the significant role general knowledge plays for everyday life, its neural foundation largely remains unknown. In a large sample of 324 healthy individuals, we used standard magnetic resonance imaging along with functional magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging to examine different estimates of brain volume and brain network connectivity and assessed their predictive power with regard to both general knowledge and fluid intelligence. Our results demonstrate that an individual's level of general knowledge is associated with structural brain network connectivity beyond any confounding effects exerted by age or sex. Moreover, we found fluid intelligence to be best predicted by cortex volume in male subjects and functional network connectivity in female subjects. Combined, these findings potentially indicate different neural architectures for information storage and information processing. \textcopyright{} 2019 European Association of Personality Psychology},

Using a psychopharmacogenetic approach, we found that testosterone increases aggression in men (N = 308) with select personality profiles and that these effects are further enhanced among those with fewer cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeats in exon 1 of the androgen receptor (AR) gene, a polymorphism associated with increased AR efficiency. Testosterone's effects were rapid (\textasciitilde 30 min after administration) and mediated, in part, by subjective reward associated with aggression. Testosterone thus appears to promote human aggression through an AR-related mechanism and to have stronger effects in men with the select personality profiles because it more strongly upregulates the subjective pleasure they derive from aggression. Given other evidence that testosterone regulates reward through dopaminergic pathways, and that the sensitivity of such pathways is enhanced among individuals with the personality profiles we identified, our findings may also implicate dopaminergic processes in testosterone's heterogeneous effects on aggression.},

  abstract = {In his seminal studies, Sherif (1935) showed that social norms can induce persistent changes in perceptual decisions. So far, however, the underlying mechanisms are not understood. Specifically, it is unclear whether social norms can lead to a persistent perceptual bias. Using a diffusion model analysis, we extended the social reinforcement account (social norms work via mechanisms of reinforcement learning). Thereby, our study is the first to disentangle whether the effect of social norms on perceptual decision-making is due to altering the uptake of sensory information (i.e., a perceptual bias) or due to shifting the decision criteria (i.e., a judgmental bias). Across two experiments, our results consistently show that learning of social norms shapes perceptual decision-making due to a lasting perceptual bias towards norm-congruent sensory information. This finding was not moderated by the sociality of the norm, that is, by how strongly norms were linked to group membership. Complementary to current psychological models, our results suggest that social norms might become and remain internalized because individuals are chronically biased towards norm-congruent information.},

  abstract = {Recognizing words and faces engages highly specialized sites within the middle fusiform gyrus, known as the visual word form area (VWFA) and fusiform face area (FFA) respectively. The VWFA and FFA have clear but opposite population-level asymmetries, with the VWFA typically being lateralized to the left and the FFA to the right hemisphere. The present study investigates how language dominance may relate to these asymmetries. We hypothesize that individuals with left hemisphere dominance for word production (i.e., left language dominance, LLD) will have typical lateralization for word and face recognition in the fusiform gyrus, whereas participants with right language dominance (RLD) will demonstrate `atypical' rightward laterality for words and leftward dominance for faces. To test this hypothesis, we recruited twenty-seven left-handers who had previously been identified as being LLD or RLD based on a visual half field task. Using fMRI, hemisphere dominance was determined for language (Broca's region) as well as for word and face recognition in the middle fusiform gyrus for each participant. The direction of asymmetry correlated significantly between language and recognizing words ({$\rho~$}=~.648, p~{$<~$}.001) as well as between language and face recognition ({$\rho~$}=~-.620, p~=~.001). Moreover, most LLD-participants were typically lateralized for faces and written words, while both functions tended to be reversed in individuals with RLD. However, segregation between language and face recognition was less clear in participants with RLD, as many of them lacked an obvious asymmetry for faces. Although our results thus suggest there is no one-on-one relationship between asymmetries for language, written word and face recognition, they also argue against a complete independence of their lateralization.},

We tracked participants' eye movements while they judged whether one billiard ball caused another one to go through a gate or prevented it from going through. Both participants' looking patterns and their judgments demonstrated that counterfactual simulation played a critical role. Participants simulated where the target ball would have gone if the candidate cause had been removed from the scene. The more certain participants were that the outcome would have been different, the stronger the causal judgments. These results provide the first direct evidence for spontaneous counterfactual simulation in an important domain of high-level cognition.},

Results revealed that final fixations successfully predicted choices when experimentally manipulated (bottom up).

Five experimental studies showed that individuals were more anxious when a significant other (e.g., their partner) intended to engage in behavior implying risk to health or safety than when they intended to engage in the same behavior themselves. This discrepancy did not emerge if the other was emotionally distant (e.g., an acquaintance), suggesting that the self-other discrepancy in anxiety is moderated by the quality of the relationship. Neither a perceived higher personal control, nor a perceived lower probability of encountering negative events, as suggested by research on self-other biases in risk assessment, accounted for the effect. However, it was partially mediated by individuals' tendency to imagine more severe consequences of others' (vs. own) risk behavior.

The resulting dataset will serve as a resource for researchers and, through the analysis provided in this article, provide an important counterpoint to similar studies from elsewhere in Britain. The methodology of the project is presented, and the limitations of the data are discussed in detail. The principal difficulties were associated with dating the building and duration of use of individual structures, and the bias created by a few sites with large numbers of excavated structures. The analysis and interpretation of the data is presented in three sections: chronology, inhabitation and landscape, and historical overview. The emphasis on recently excavated sites with good chronological control has enabled a more confident reconstruction of the history of roundhouse occupation in Wales. This has shown that while the architectural form has relatively early origins with numbers beginning to grow after 1500 BC, it is primarily a feature of first millennium BC and early first millennium AD landscapes. During the first millennium BC, timber- and stone-built settlements are common, initially as enclosed sites, and later, by the Roman period, as both open and enclosed settlements. This is contrary to the situation in many other parts of Britain, where roundhouses and frequently field systems are dated to at least the mid-second millennium BC onwards. There were strong regional differences between regions at this time, with for instance the predominance of stone- and clay-built sites in north-west Wales and the absence of Roman period roundhouses in the north-east. The dataset derived from the project will remain as an important resource with which to research these regional differences in greater detail and to examine the implications of new fieldwork discoveries. It will also serve as a model for future synthesis of later prehistoric and early historic settlement architecture in Britain. The core data are available as a searchable database. The full dataset is archived with the Archaeology Data Service.},

  abstract = {Multisite phosphorylation and structural flexibility allow for complex regulation of proteins through cellular signaling. Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), a key enzyme of catecholamine synthesis, is regulated by multiple neuronal signaling pathways through phosphorylation at serine 19 (Ser19), serine 31 (Ser31), and serine 40 (Ser40) located in the flexible, far N-terminal region of the regulatory domain. Phosphorylated Ser19 (pSer19) provides a binding site for 14-3-3 proteins, a family of multi-target binding adaptor proteins. We hypothesized that pSer19 and 14-3-3 binding can regulate access to the Ser31 and Ser40 sites and modulate the dynamics of their phosphorylation state. To avoid complications from upstream signal interactions and have good control of TH-phosphorylation and 14-3-3 binding stoichiometry, we used purified recombinant human TH and 14-3-3 dimer types. We found that pSer19 strongly stimulated Ser31 phosphorylation (4.6-fold), but inhibited pSer31 dephosphorylation (3.4-fold). Binding of 14-3-3{$\zeta$} counteracted the stimulatory effect of pSer19 on phosphorylation at Ser31, but amplified the effect on its dephosphorylation. In contrast, phosphorylation at Ser19 had moderate effect on pSer40 dephosphorylation, but 14-3-3{$\zeta$} binding inhibited dephosphorylation, an effect that was consistent across different homo- and heterodimeric 14-3-3s. Additional phosphorylation of Ser31 or Ser40 had little impact on the binding affinity of pSer19 TH to 14-3-3s. Mathematical modeling was performed to elucidate possible physiological implications of these observations. We propose a role of Ser19 and 14-3-3 proteins as modulators of TH phosphorylation in response to neuronal co-signaling events. These mechanisms add to our understanding of the multifaceted roles of phosphorylation and adaptor proteins in cellular signaling.},

Across three replicated experiments, we demonstrated that native English speakers are more likely to interpret implausible utterances, such as ``the mother gave the candle the daughter,'' as similar plausible utterances (``the mother gave the candle to the daughter'') when the speaker has a foreign accent.

An initial double-blind experiment failed to demonstrate the expected effects of a social prime on executive cognition. To determine whether double-blind procedures caused this result, we independently manipulated participants' exposure to a prime and experimenters' belief about which prime participants received. Across four experiments, we found that experimenter belief, rather than prime condition, altered participant behavior. Experimenter belief also altered participants' perceptions of their experimenter, suggesting that differences in experimenter behavior across conditions caused the effect. Findings reinforce double-blind designs as experimental best practice and suggest that people's prior beliefs have important consequences for shaping behavior with an interaction partner.},

Piaget suggested that children need to learn the physical rules that govern their environment before they can represent abstract concepts such as number and time. Thus, learning how objects move in space and time may underpin the development of related abstract representations (i.e., mathematics). To test this hypothesis, we captured objective measures of interceptive timing in 309 primary school children (5\textendash 11 years old), alongside scores for general motor skill and national standardized academic attainment. Bayesian estimation showed that interceptive timing (but not general motor capability) uniquely predicted mathematical ability even after we controlled for age, reading, and writing attainment. This finding demonstrates that interceptive timing is distinct from other motor skills with specificity in predicting childhood mathematical ability independently of other forms of attainment and motor capability.},

  abstract = {When reprehensible conduct is explicable in terms of the offender's life history or underlying biology, blame is mitigated. Despite their shared capacity for blame mitigation, here we focus on differences between historical and biological explanations for bad conduct. We argue that historical explanations generate greater uncertainty about blameworthiness than do biological explanations. They do so because they have both competing and tentative implications regarding agent control. Furthermore, we argue that the blame uncertainty engendered by historical explanations enables motivated cognition in the blame process. We provide evidence for these claims in four studies. In Study 1, we show that computer mouse trajectories are less direct\textemdash suggesting uncertainty\textemdash when blame assessments are made in cases of historical as compared to biological causation. Studies 2, 3, and 4 test our claims regarding susceptibility to biased cognition. Predisposition to blame was measured in Studies 2 and 3 and manipulated in Study 4. In all studies, predisposition to blame was more potent in shaping blame judgments in cases of historical as compared to biological causation. Evidence suggests that this happened because cases of historical causation are relatively amenable to divergent construals regarding agent control, whereas the implications of biological causation are more definitive. Discussion centers on the importance of motivation\textemdash a ``merciful mindset''\textemdash for effecting blame mitigation in cases where the offender has endured an unfortunate life history.},

  abstract = {Prism adaptation (PA) after-effects are assessed using tests that measure changes in sensorimotor systems. After-effects on pointing without feedback to a visual target (open loop pointing \textendash{} OLP) are traditionally described as being larger than those measured by straight ahead pointing (SAP) with eyes closed, and the difference between them is attributed to a shift in visual localisation. However, neither differences between OLP and SAP, nor shifts in perceptual judgement of visual straight ahead (VSA), are consistently reported. Moreover, since very few studies have directly recorded direction of gaze, an effect of PA on the state estimate of gaze direction has not been reliably documented. The current research aimed to isolate the effects of PA on state estimates of eye position. We measured sensorimotor after-effects through common (OLP, SAP, and VSA) measures, and also recorded eye position and additional after-effect measures to interrogate changes to the oculomotor system and how these might relate to other measures of sensorimotor change. To ascertain if PA's effects on estimates of eye position could be attributed to eye muscle potentiation, we compared the effects of PA to sustained gaze deviation without adaptation. PA induced no effect on visual straight-ahead and no change in direction of gaze, when measured while positioning a target, looking straight ahead in the dark, or looking toward the passively positioned and occluded unexposed hand. We also found that after-effects measured by SAP with the eyes open were larger than SAP with the eyes closed and equal to those observed with OLP. The findings challenge the concept that total adaptation after-effect is a direct sum of arm proprioceptive and visual after-effects as conventionally measured, and suggest that the oculomotor system is altered by prism adaptation only in interaction with an arm motor command when vision is available.},

By contrast, anger is activated in response to information about actions, including their moral wrongness and consequences. Study 1 examined disgust and anger in response to an action that suggests bad moral character (animal cruelty) versus an action that is seen as inherently more wrong (domestic abuse). Animal cruelty was associated with more disgust than domestic abuse was, whereas domestic abuse was associated with more anger. Studies 2 and 3 manipulated character by varying the agent's desire to cause harm and also varied the action's harmful consequences. Desire to harm predicted only disgust (controlling for anger), whereas consequences were more closely related to anger (controlling for disgust). Taken together, these results indicate that disgust arises in response to evidence of bad moral character, not just to impurity.},

One account claims that the official ballot liberates dependent voters from the dictates of local elites, thereby enhancing democratic competition. Another argues that in contexts of widespread illiteracy, its adoption may be tantamount to a suffrage restriction. This article adjudicates between these views by drawing upon an original data set of municipal-level voting returns from Brazil's Second Republic (1945\textendash 1964). The unique staggered rollout of the official ballot during this period permits one to assess its impact with unprecedented accuracy. The article finds that the primary consequence of ballot reform was suffrage restriction. Rather than liberating poor and dependent voters, the official ballot made it exceedingly difficult for these individuals to vote. Moreover, parliamentary debates indicate that this was an anticipated and intended effect of the reform.},

We established the role that impurity played in these effects through mediation and moderation. We found that inauthenticity-induced cleansing and compensatory helping were driven by heightened feelings of impurity rather than by the psychological discomfort of dissonance. Similarly, physically cleansing oneself eliminated the relationship between inauthenticity and prosocial compensation. Finally, we obtained additional evidence for discriminant validity: The observed effects on desire for cleansing were not driven by general negative experiences (i.e., failing a test) but were unique to experiences of inauthenticity. Our results establish that authenticity is a moral state\textemdash that being true to thine own self is experienced as a form of virtue.},

This survey covered all periods from the Neolithic to the present day, a wide range of topographical and environmental contexts, and a broad spectrum of disciplinary and interdisciplinary expertise. In this study we focus on some core themes, particularly the relationship between farming and mining, the control of production, and the spatial differentiation of human activity across the landscape.

That is, people overestimate the chances that whatever is happening now, will happen in the future, even when the (known) explicit probabilities of future outcomes contradict such a belief. This appears to be driven by an anchoring and (insufficient) adjustment process, whereby initial beliefs about the future are heavily influenced by the present circumstances, and then subsequent beliefs are not sufficiently adjusted once the probabilities of future outcomes are learned. Across nine studies (employing over 3800 participants), we demonstrate the FIN bias in a variety of forecasting contexts, show that it manifests in incentive compatible settings, and provide evidence in support of an anchoring and (insufficient) adjustment mechanistic account.},

For example, they show preferences that change as a result of task framing or of adding irrelevant alternatives into the choice set. A recent theory has proposed that such choice and risk biases arise from an attentional mechanism that increases the relative weighting of goal-consistent information and protects the decision from noise after the sensory stage. Here, using a divided-attention method based on the dot-probe technique, we showed that attentional selection toward values congruent with the task goal takes place while participants make choices between alternatives that consist of payoff sequences. Moreover, we demonstrated that the magnitude of this attentional selection predicts risk attitudes, indicating a common underlying cognitive process. The results highlight the dynamic interplay between attention and choice mechanisms in producing framing effects and risk biases.},

The present study aimed to assess whether affordance effects highlighted in action priming paradigms could be affected by object category (manufactured or natural). A total of 24 young adults performed a semantic categorisation task on natural and manufactured target objects presented after neutral (non-grasping hand postures) or action (congruent power or precision grips) primes. Results revealed a modulation of action priming effects as a function of object category. Object semantic categorisation was faster after action than neutral primes, but only for manufactured objects. Results suggest that natural and manufactured objects evoke distinct types of affordances and that action priming paradigms favour the evocation of functional affordances during object semantic categorisation. This finding fuels the debate on the nature of the motor information evoked by visual objects.},

A large body of research has implicated left parietal regions in symbolic number processing. One possible explanation for this lateralization of neural activity is the handedness of participants. Specifically, participants in neuroimaging research are almost exclusively right-handed. The current study sought to probe whether number representation in the brain is associated with hand preference for handwriting. To address this question, we used functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to compare brain activation of a group of right-handed participants with a group of left-handed participants during the passive viewing of symbolic numbers. At the whole-brain level, the right-handers demonstrated a previously obtained left-lateralized effect within the intraparietal sulcus (IPS). The left-handers showed some evidence of reverse lateralization of this effect in the IPS. However, when the groups were statistically compared, we found no regions that demonstrated group-level differences. In a follow-up region of interest (ROI) analysis within the left and right parietal lobes, we calculated laterality indices for each participant. Results did not provide support for group differences in laterality within the right or left IPS ROI. These findings do not support the hypothesis that handwriting plays a role in the lateralization of symbolic number processing in the brain. Further research is needed to better understand the factors that lead to left-lateralization for symbolic number processing.},

Results showed that degrading either collective ties (i.e., sentiments toward the group as a whole) or relational ties (i.e., sentiments toward individual group members) lowered identity fusion with the group (Studies 1\textendash 3 \& 6). Lowered fusion, in turn, explained the tendency for weakened collective and relational ties to reduce endorsement of pro-group action, and this effect replicated cross-sectionally and longitudinally (Studies 2, 4 \& 6). Additional evidence revealed that attenuated group-related agency seemed to mediate the relationship between weakened identity fusion and diminished commitment to help the group (Studies 3, 4 \& 6). Although degrading collective ties reduced overall group identification (Studies 1\textendash 3 \& 6), degrading relational ties did not reliably do so (Studies 1\textendash 6). Instead, degrading relational ties only reduced scores on a single component (ingroup solidarity) of a multidimensional measure of group identification (Studies 5 \& 6). Hence, measures of identity fusion are equally sensitive to relational and collective ties while measures of identification emphasize collective ties. The results replicated whether we considered country (Studies 1\textendash 5) or gender (i.e. females, Study 6) as the focal social group. These findings therefore highlight the unique properties of fusion and identification and help explain why identity fusion predicts extreme pro-group behavior with greater fidelity than group identification.},

Recent analyses have challenged this simple account, suggesting that attentional selection during the attentional blink is not only (a) suppressed, but also (b) temporally advanced then delayed, and (c) temporally diffused. Here, we reanalyzed six data sets using mixture modeling of report errors, and revealed much simpler dynamics. Exposing a problem inherent in previous analyses, we found evidence of a second attentional episode only when the second target (T2) follows the first (T1) by more than 100 to 250 ms. When a second episode occurs, suppression and delay reduce steadily as lag increases and temporal precision is stable. At shorter lags, both targets are reported from a single episode, which explains why T2 can escape the attentional blink when it immediately follows T1 (Lag-1 sparing).},

The current article explores this through two self-report studies. In study 1 (N = 228) a series of hierarchical regression analyses showed that, for three out of four domains of prosocial behavior, symbolization was the only significant predictor, and that its strength differed across outcomes. Building on these results, Study 2 (N = 299) proposed that the observed vs. anonymous nature of prosocial behavior could account for these differences. Unexpectedly, symbolization predicted both public and private behaviors, whereas internalization generally did not. Significant interactions between internalization and symbolization were also observed. These findings are discussed in relation to their theoretical implications and future moral identity research.},

Results of Study 1 revealed that rendering differences in performance visible in the classroom by having students raise their hands was enough to undermine the achievement of working-class students. In Studies 2 and 3, we manipulated students' familiarity with an arbitrary standard as a proxy for social class. Our results suggest that classroom settings that make differences in performance visible undermine the achievement of the students who are less familiar with academic culture. In Study 3, we showed that being aware of the advantage in familiarity with a task restores the performance of the students who have less familiarity with the task.},

In the current study, we showed that temporal-order perception may be considered a psychological bias that attention can modulate but not fully eradicate. According to Titchener's law of prior entry, attention prioritizes the perception of an event and thus can help compensate for possible interindividual differences in the perceived timing of an event by normalizing perception in time. In a longitudinal study, we tested the stability of participants' temporal-order perception across and within sensory modalities, together with the magnitude of the participants' prior-entry effect. All measurements showed the persistence of stable interindividual variability. Crucially, the magnitude of the prior-entry effect was insufficient to compensate for interindividual variability: Conscious time order was systematically subjective, and therefore traceable on an individual basis.},

We also explored the relationship between linguistic outcomes and other teaching/teacher factors: teaching time, teacher level of French proficiency, and teacher level of training in language instruction. Learners completed a sentence repetition task and a photo description task, making small but statistically significant progress in both grammatical and lexical knowledge between test points. While teaching approach had little impact on such progress, other teaching and teacher factors did, particularly the French proficiency level of the primary school teacher and the amount of teaching time devoted to French.},

  abstract = {Changes in glycerophosphocholine metabolism are observed in Alzheimer's disease; however, it is not known whether these metabolic disruptions are linked to cognitive decline. Here, using unbiased lipidomic approaches and direct biochemical assessments, we profiled Land's cycle lipid remodeling in the hippocampus, frontal cortex, and temporal-parietal-entorhinal cortices of human amyloid beta precursor protein ({$A\beta$}PP) over-expressing mice. We identified a cortex-specific hypo-metabolic signature at symptomatic onset and a cortex-specific hyper-metabolic signature of Land's cycle glycerophosphocholine remodeling over the course of progressive behavioral decline. When N5 TgCRND8 and {$A\beta$}PPSwe/PSIdE9 mice first exhibited deficits in the Morris Water Maze, levels of lyso-phosphatidylcholines, LPC(18:0/0:0), LPC(16:0/0:0), LPC(24:6/0:0), LPC(25:6/0:0), the lyso-platelet-activating factor (PAF), LPC(O-18:0/0:0), and the PAF, PC(O-22:6/2:0), declined as a result of reduced calcium-dependent cytosolic phospholipase A2{$\alpha$} (cPLA2{$\alpha$}) activity in all cortices but not hippocampus. Chronic intermittent hypoxia, an environmental risk factor that triggers earlier learning memory impairment in {$A\beta$}PPSwe/PSIdE9 mice, elicited these same metabolic changes in younger animals. Thus, this lipidomic signature of phenoconversion appears age-independent. By contrast, in symptomatic N5 TgCRND8 mice, cPLA2{$\alpha$} activity progressively increased; overall Lyso-phosphatidylcholines (LPC) and LPC(O) and PC(O-18:1/2:0) levels progressively rose. Enhanced cPLA2{$\alpha$} activity was only detected in transgenic mice; however, age-dependent increases in the PAF acetylhydrolase 1b {$\alpha$}1 to {$\alpha$}2 expression ratio, evident in both transgenic and non-transgenic mice, reduced PAF hydrolysis thereby contributing to PAF accumulation. Taken together, these data identify distinct age-independent and age-dependent disruptions in Land's cycle metabolism linked to symptomatic onset and progressive behavioral decline in animals with pre-existing {$A\beta$} pathology.

We investigated whether these relational costs might be offset by status benefits, and the processes underlying such benefits. Across eight experiments (N = 1456), we found that winners who expressed positive emotion were perceived as higher in social standing than winners who suppressed positive emotion. To understand the mechanisms underlying this effect, we manipulated factors to do with the situation in which emotion was expressed, the type of person expressing emotion, and the way emotion was expressed. We also conducted replications of these experiments. The only factor that consistently moderated the expressivity effect was perceived authenticity, such that expressive winners only gained status benefits when observers believed the emotion expression was authentic. The findings point to the power of context in shaping the nature of the social benefits reaped by expressing positive emotion.},

Individuals suffering economic strain may vote for Islamists because they believe this to be an intrinsically virtuous act that will be met with divine rewards in the afterlife. We explore this hypothesis through a series of laboratory experiments in Tunisia. Individuals assigned to treatment conditions instilling feelings of economic strain exhibit greater support for Islamist parties, and this support is causally mediated by an expectation of divine compensation in the hereafter.

  abstract = {Popular psychological accounts argue that successful candidates address their appeals to citizens' ``hearts'' rather than their ``heads.'' Yet research on campaigns shows that candidates win elections by getting voters to think about particular issues\textemdash especially issues that create ambivalence in the minds of opposition supporters. This article helps to reconcile these ``heart-centered'' and ``head-centered'' accounts of preference formation during campaigns. An original experiment and ANES data analyses (1980\textendash 2004) show that a ``good gut feeling'' toward a candidate helps citizens to overcome the paralyzing effect of ambivalence on attitude formation and turnout. And, since turnout is most tenuous among those with lower income, this is where the effect is most pronounced. Since Democratic candidates rely disproportionately on support from these lower-income voters, it is particularly important that they inspire positive affect among latent supporters.},

  abstract = {It is well known that feelings of happiness transfer between individuals through mimicry induced by vision and hearing. The evidence is inconclusive, however, as to whether happiness can be communicated through the sense of smell via chemosignals. As chemosignals are a known medium for transferring negative emotions from a sender to a receiver, we examined whether chemosignals are also involved in the transmission of positive emotions. Positive emotions are important for overall well-being and yet relatively neglected in research on chemosignaling, arguably because of the stronger survival benefits linked with negative emotions. We observed that exposure to body odor collected from senders of chemosignals in a happy state induced a facial expression and perceptual-processing style indicative of happiness in the receivers of those signals. Our findings suggest that not only negative affect but also a positive state (happiness) can be transferred by means of odors.},

Participants were assigned a partner and could increase their payoff by coordinated lying. After several interactions, they were either free to choose whether to stay with or switch their partner or forced to stay with or switch their partner. Results reveal that both dishonest and honest people exploit the freedom to choose a partner. Dishonest people seek a partner who will also lie\textemdash a ``partner in crime.'' Honest people, by contrast, engage in ethical free riding: They refrain from lying but also from leaving dishonest partners, taking advantage of their partners' lies. We conclude that to curb collaborative corruption, relying on people's honesty is insufficient. Encouraging honest individuals not to engage in ethical free riding is essential.},

We conducted a pre-registered replication of the study of self-construal priming on spatial memory by K\"uhnen and Oyserman (2002; Study 2), simultaneously evaluating the role of task-compliance, operationalization specificity, and cross-cultural robustness. In the original study, participants either circled first-person plural (interdependent condition) or singular pronouns (independent condition) when reading a passage and subsequently memorized and recalled a set of objects presented on a visual-spatial grid. When employing a digital version of the original procedure, we were able to replicate the original findings, with better recall of objects in their original location in the interdependent (vs. independent) condition. Notably, the effect of self-construal priming on spatial memory was strongest when screening out participants who did not comply with instructions on the pronoun task and absent when including non-compliant participants. Moreover, in contrast to the original study, effects of priming were not specific to object-\&-location operationalization of spatial memory recall, and also present for location-independent object recall and object-independent spatial placement recall. Additionally, condition effects were robust across observed cultural differences: Though white participants performing less successfully compared to non-white participants, both groups were comparably susceptible to priming effects. We discuss the present results and insights learned from the replication process in light of the on-going debate about the replicability of psychological experiments, highlighting the notion of task-compliance, methodological transparency and cross-cultural factors for further advancement of psychological science.},

We tested five key hypotheses regarding cultural change in individualism-collectivism. As predicted by previous theories, changes in socioeconomic structure, pathogen prevalence, and secularism accompanied changes in individualism averaged across all measures. The relationship with changes in individualism was less robust for urbanization. Contrary to previous theories, changes in individualism were positively (as opposed to negatively) related to the frequency of disasters. Time-lagged analyses suggested that only socioeconomic structure had a robust effect on individualism; changes in socioeconomic structure preceded changes in individualism. Implications for anthropology, psychology, and sociology are discussed.},

Objective To determine whether a change in editorial policy, including the implementation of a checklist, has been associated with improved reporting of measures which might reduce the risk of bias.
Methods The study protocol has been published at doi: 10.1007/s11192-016-1964-8.
Design Observational cohort study.
Population Articles describing research in the life sciences published in Nature journals, submitted after 1 May 2013.
Intervention Mandatory completion of a checklist during manuscript revision.
Comparators (1) Articles describing research in the life sciences published in Nature journals, submitted before May 2013; and (2) similar articles in other journals matched for date and topic.
Primary outcome The primary outcome is change in the proportion of Nature articles describing in vivo research published before and after May 2013 reporting the `Landis 4' items (randomisation, blinding, sample size calculation and exclusions). We included 448 Nature Publishing Group (NPG) articles (223 published before May 2013, and 225 after) identified by an individual hired by NPG for this specific task, working to a standard procedure; and an independent investigator used PubMed `Related Citations' to identify 448 non-NPG articles with a similar topic and date of publication from other journals; and then redacted all articles for time-sensitive information and journal name. Redacted articles were assessed by two trained reviewers against a 74-item checklist, with discrepancies resolved by a third.
Results 394 NPG and 353 matching non-NPG articles described in vivo research. The number of NPG articles meeting all relevant Landis 4 criteria increased from 0/203 prior to May 2013 to 31/181 (16.4\%) after (two-sample test for equality of proportions without continuity correction, {$X^2$}=36.2, df=1, p=1.8\texttimes 10-9). There was no change in the proportion of non-NPG articles meeting all relevant Landis 4 criteria (1/164 before, 1/189 after). There were more substantial improvements in the individual prevalences of reporting of randomisation, blinding, exclusions and sample size calculations for in vivo experiments, and less substantial improvements for in vitro experiments.
Conclusion There was an improvement in the reporting of risks of bias in in vivo research in NPG journals following a change in editorial policy, to a level that to our knowledge has not been previously observed. However, there remain opportunities for further improvement.},

Drawing from social comparison theory, we propose that managers high on social comparison orientation respond more favorably to voice expressions that come from opposite-gender subordinates than to those from same-gender ones. Given the importance of social emotions to social comparison processes, we posit that gratitude can play a central role in determining managerial response to voice expressions. In two experimental studies with managers in Brazil (Study 1) and the United States (Study 2), we found consistent support for our hypothesized interactive effect of social comparison orientation and manager-subordinate gender match on managerial response to voice expressions. In addition, we found that managers' experienced gratitude mediated this effect (Study 2). Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.},

We demonstrated, for the first time, that the left supramarginal gyrus is one of the key nodes of the STM network involved in retaining an abstract representation of serial order information, independently from the content information, namely the nature of the item to be remembered, which instead is stored separately.},

Whereas children have been shown to be averse to gender nonconformity in peers, because many transgender children appear and behave in ways consistent with their expressed gender (but not their sex at birth), it is unclear how children evaluate these identities. In 2 studies, we investigated 5- to 10year-old children's (Ntotal = 113) preferences for transgender versus gender-``typical'' peers who either shared their gender identity or did not. We also examined whether children categorized transgender peers by their sex or expressed gender, as it might inform their evaluations. Children preferred cisgender peers over transgender peers; however, they also liked peers of their own gender rather than the other gender (e.g., female participants preferred girls over boys), demonstrating that the oft-documented own-gender bias plays an important role even when children are reasoning about transgender peers. Children did not reliably categorize transgender peers by sex or gender; yet those who categorized transgender peers by their sex showed greater dislike of transgender peers. The current studies are the first to investigate cisgender children's attitudes toward transgender children and suggest that perceptions of gender categorization and conformity play a role in children's evaluations of transgender peers.},

To address this question, we used a dual-task paradigm: Participants prepared an action (e.g., grasping), while concurrently performing an orientation-change-detection task. We demonstrated that as actions became more fluent (e.g., as grasping errors decreased), perceptual-discrimination performance also improved. Importantly, we found that grasping training prior to discrimination enhanced subsequent perceptual sensitivity, supporting the notion of a reciprocal relation between perception and action.},

On one hand, research has suggested that framing effects evolve through the deliberation process, growing larger with time. On the other hand, dual-process theory attributes framing effects to an intuitive, emotional system that responds automatically to stimuli. In our experiments, participants made decisions about gambles framed in terms of either gains or losses, and time pressure was manipulated across blocks. Results showed increased framing effects under time pressure in both hypothetical and incentivized choices, which supports the dual-process hypothesis that these effects arise from a fast, intuitive system.},

Understanding this basic decision-making process is key if we are to gain insight on how to combat societal problems like obesity and other issues related to diet. We found that participants allocated more attention to items with lower attitude accessibility, but tended to choose items with higher attitude accessibility. Higher attitude certainty and stability had no effects on attention, but led to more attitude-consistent choices. These results imply that people are not simply choosing in line with their subjective values but are affected by other aspects of their attitudes. In addition, our attitude accessibility results indicate that more attention is not always beneficial.},

Reaction times and error rates were recorded for free combinations, collocations, and baseline items. There was a processing cost for collocations compared to free combinations, for both groups of participants. This cost likely stems from the semantically semi?transparent nature of collocations as they are defined in the phraseological tradition. Furthermore, phrasal frequency based on corpus values also predicted reaction times. These results lend initial support to the Continuum Model from a processing perspective and suggest that degree of semantic transparency together with phrasal frequency plays an important role in collocational processing.},

Past models of food preference have assumed that social concerns are dissociated from basic appetitive qualities\textemdash such as tastiness\textemdash in food choice. In contrast to this notion, we tested and found support for the novel idea that social identities can shape the evaluation of food pleasantness. Specifically, individual differences in social identification (Study 1) as well as experimentally manipulated identity salience (Study 2) were associated with the anticipated tastiness of identity-relevant foods. We also found that identity salience influenced perceived food pleasantness during consumption (Study 3). These results suggest social identity may shape evaluations of food pleasantness, both through long-term motivational components of identification as well as short-term identity salience. Thus, the influence of social identity on cognition appears to extend beyond social evaluation, to hedonic experience. We discuss implications for theories of identity, decision-making, and food consumption.},

In two novel economic games, we manipulated the amount of money with which participants were endowed and then gave them the opportunity to share resources with others. We found that people reciprocated more toward higher-wealth givers, compared with lower-wealth givers, even when those givers were equally generous. Wealthier givers also achieved better reputations than less wealthy ones and therefore received more investments in a social marketplace. These discrepancies were well described by a formal model of reinforcement learning: Individuals who weighted monetary outcomes, rather than generosity, when learning about interlocutors also most strongly helped wealthier individuals. This work demonstrates that reciprocity and reputation\textemdash although globally increasing prosociality\textemdash can widen wealth gaps and provides a precise account of how inequality grows through social processes.},

Despite this common basis, recent research has shown that the consistency of people's choices across different mixed-motive games is rather low. The present research examined behavioural consistency within the same mixed-motive game, by presenting participants with a series of one-shot Prisoner's Dilemma Games. Across this set of games, payoffs were manipulated in order to intensify or weaken the conflict between self and the other party while maintaining the game's underlying structure. Our findings indicate that significant differences in choice behaviour are observed as a function of both situational (i.e. manipulations of the Prisoner's Dilemma Game's payoff structure) and personality differences (i.e. individual differences in personality and motivational traits). Moreover, our included situational variables and personality features did not interact with each other and were about equally impactful in shaping cooperation. Crucially, however, despite the significant behavioural differences across game variants, considerable consistency in choices was found as well, which suggests that the game's motivational basis reliably impacts choice behaviour in spite of situational and personality variations. We discuss implications for theorizing on mixed-motive situations and elaborate on the question how cooperation can be promoted. \textcopyright{} 2018 European Association of Personality Psychology},

But do equal inheritances succeed in leveling the societal playing field? We study Germany\textemdash a country with pronounced local-level variation in inheritance customs\textemdash and find that municipalities that historically equally apportioned wealth, to this day, elect more women into political councils and have fewer aristocrats in the social elite. Using historic data, we point to two mechanisms: wealth equality and pro-egalitarian preferences. In a final step, we also show that, counterintuitively, equitable inheritance customs positively predict income inequality. We interpret this finding to mean that equitable inheritances level the playing field by rewarding talent, not status.},

We tested the hypothesis that a different belief of parents\textemdash their failure mind-sets\textemdash may be more visible to children and therefore more prominent in shaping their beliefs. In Study 1, we found that parents can view failure as debilitating or enhancing, and that these failure mind-sets predict parenting practices and, in turn, children's intelligence mind-sets. Study 2 probed more deeply into how parents display failure mind-sets. In Study 3a, we found that children can indeed accurately perceive their parents' failure mind-sets but not their parents' intelligence mind-sets. Study 3b showed that children's perceptions of their parents' failure mind-sets also predicted their own intelligence mind-sets. Finally, Study 4 showed a causal effect of parents' failure mind-sets on their responses to their children's hypothetical failure. Overall, parents who see failure as debilitating focus on their children's performance and ability rather than on their children's learning, and their children, in turn, tend to believe that intelligence is fixed rather than malleable.},

We find that naturalization rates surged by about 60\% once politicians rather than citizens began deciding on naturalization applications. Whereas voters in referendums face no cost of arbitrarily rejecting qualified applicants based on discriminatory preferences, politicians in the council are constrained to formally justify rejections and may be held accountable by judicial review. Consistent with this mechanism, the increase in naturalization rates caused by switching from direct to representative democracy is much stronger for more marginalized immigrant groups and in areas where voters are more xenophobic or where judicial review is more salient.},

In an experiment with 447 participants, we examined whether sharing attention increased affiliation irrespective of the co-attended stimulus (the stimulus-independent hypothesis), or based on the co-attended stimulus (the stimulus-dependent hypothesis). The results substantiated the stimulus-dependent hypothesis, confirming that the effect of shared attention on affiliation depends on the stimulus under shared attention. More specifically, whereas belief-affirming messages under shared attention increased felt closeness to the co-attendee, belief-disaffirming and mixed messages under shared attention did not increase felt closeness to the co-attendee.

We recorded electroencephalogram (EEG) activity during two tasks that employed identical stimulus displays but varied the relative demands for object storage and spatial attention. We found distinct delay-period signatures for an attention task (which required only spatial attention) and a WM task (which invoked both spatial attention and object storage). Although both tasks required active maintenance of spatial information, only the WM task elicited robust contralateral delay activity that was sensitive to mnemonic load. Thus, we argue that the focus of attention is maintained via a collaboration between distinct processes for covert spatial orienting and object-based storage.},

  abstract = {Abstract The activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (ARC) is critical for long-term synaptic plasticity and memory formation. Acting as a protein interaction hub, ARC regulates diverse signalling events in postsynaptic neurons. A protein interaction site is present in the ARC C-terminal domain (CTD), a bilobar structure homologous to the retroviral Gag capsid domain. We hypothesized that detailed knowledge of the three-dimensional molecular structure of monomeric full-length ARC is crucial to understand its function; therefore, we set out to determine the structure of ARC to understand its various functional modalities. We purified recombinant ARC and analyzed its structure using small-angle X-ray scattering and synchrotron radiation circular dichroism spectroscopy. Monomeric full-length ARC has a compact, closed structure, in which the oppositely charged N-terminal domain (NTD) and CTD are juxtaposed, and the flexible linker between them is not extended. The modeled structure of ARC is supported by intramolecular live-cell F\"orster resonance energy transfer imaging in rat hippocampal slices. Peptides from several postsynaptic proteins, including stargazin, bind to the N-lobe, but not to the C-lobe, of the bilobar CTD. This interaction does not induce large-scale conformational changes in the CTD or flanking unfolded regions. The ARC NTD contains long helices, predicted to form an anti-parallel coiled coil; binding of ARC to phospholipid membranes requires the NTD. Our data support a role for the ARC NTD in oligomerization as well as lipid membrane binding. The findings have important implications for the structural organization of ARC with respect to distinct functions, such as postsynaptic signal transduction and virus-like capsid formation.

  abstract = {Although the mechanisms by which mutant huntingtin (mHtt) results in Huntington's disease (HD) remain unclear, mHtt-induced mitochondrial defects were implicated in HD pathogenesis. The effect of mHtt could be mediated by transcriptional alterations, by direct interaction with mitochondria, or by both. In the present study, we tested a hypothesis that mHtt directly damages mitochondria. To test this hypothesis, we applied brain cytosolic fraction from YAC128 mice, containing mHtt, to brain non-synaptic and synaptic mitochondria from wild-type mice and assessed mitochondrial respiration with a Clark-type oxygen electrode, membrane potential and Ca2+ uptake capacity with tetraphenylphosphonium (TPP+)- and Ca2+-sensitive electrodes, respectively, and, reactive oxygen species production with Amplex Red assay. The amount of mHtt bound to mitochondria following incubation with mHtt-containing cytosolic fraction was greater than the amount of mHtt bound to brain mitochondria isolated from YAC128 mice. Despite mHtt binding to wild-type mitochondria, no abnormalities in mitochondrial functions were detected. This is consistent with our previous results demonstrating the lack of defects in brain mitochondria isolated from R6/2 and YAC128 mice. This, however, could be because of partial loss of mitochondrially bound mHtt during the isolation procedure. Consequently, we increased the amount of mitochondrially bound mHtt by incubating brain non-synaptic and synaptic mitochondria isolated from YAC128 mice with mHtt-containing cytosolic fraction. Despite the enrichment of YAC128 brain mitochondria with mHtt, mitochondrial functions (respiration, membrane potential, reactive oxygen species production, Ca2+ uptake capacity) remained unchanged. Overall, our results suggest that mHtt does not directly impair mitochondrial functions, arguing against the involvement of this mechanism in HD pathogenesis.

Across four studies (N = 2182), using samples from Germany, the UK, and the USA, agreement with aphorisms was high in the absence of source attribution. In contrast, atheists agreed less with brief aphorisms when they were presented as Bible verses (Studies 1 and 2), whereas Christians agreed more (Study 2). Democrats and Republicans (USA) and Labour supporters and Conservative supporters (UK) agreed more with politically non-divisive aphorisms that were presented as originating from a politician belonging to their own party (e.g., Clinton, Trump, Corbyn) than with the same aphorisms when they were presented as originating from a politician belonging to the rival party (Studies 3 and 4). This source attribution effect was not moderated by education, amount of thinking about the aphorisms, identification with the ingroup, trust, dissonance, fear of reproach, or attitude strength. We conclude that source attribution fundamentally interferes with epistemic progress in debate because of the way in which attributions of statements to sources powerfully affects reasoning about their arguments.},

Findings reveal that, controlling for baseline happiness, ex-offenders (N = 501) report greater positive affect after recalling a time they spent money on others than after recalling a time they spent money on themselves. Similarly, delinquent youth (N = 64) and ex-offenders (N = 777) randomly assigned to purchase an item for a needy child reported greater positive affect than those who purchased an item for themselves. Finally, a large pre-registered replication (N = 1295) suggests the immediate emotional benefits of prosocial spending are detectable among ex-offenders when controlling for baseline happiness.

Here, we explore whether psychology journals could ameliorate some of the field's statistical ailments by adopting specialized statistical review: a focused technical assessment, performed by statistical experts, that addresses the analysis and presentation of quantitative information and supplements regular peer review. We discuss evidence from a recent survey of journal editors suggesting that specialized statistical review may be unusual in psychology journals and is regarded by many editors as unnecessary. We contrast these views with those in the biomedical domain, where statistical review has been considered a partial preventive measure against the improper use of statistics since the late 1970s. We suggest that the current ``credibility revolution'' presents an opportune occasion for psychology journals to consider adopting specialized statistical review.},

In two longitudinal studies, we explored whether extraversion is prospectively associated with higher levels of satisfaction during college through influencing college social experiences using longitudinal cross?lagged mediation models. In both studies, students' extraversion at the beginning of college predicted their subjective well?being 4~years later. In both studies, extraversion at the beginning of college predicted a variety of self?reported and peer?reported social experiences (e.g. feelings of belonging and size of social network). We tested whether qualitative or quantitative aspects of social experiences explained the association between extraversion and subjective well?being. In the first study, neither type of social experience explained the effect of extraversion on satisfaction. Only qualitative social experiences in the second study were instrumental in explaining this effect. The results suggest that extraversion's ability to create better social experiences can play a role in extraverts' greater subjective well?being, but these experiences are not the only reason extraverts are happier and more satisfied.

Although a large number of studies have investigated approach and avoidance elicited by specific sensory stimuli, comparatively little is known about default approach biases when stimulus information is absent or reduced. The amygdala is well known to contribute to approach and avoidance behaviors in response to specific sensory stimuli; we tested whether the amygdala's role might extend to situations in which stimulus information is reduced. In a novel task, 3 patients with rare bilateral amygdala lesions (and control subjects) made approach-related judgments about photos of intact faces and of the same faces with all internal facial features occluded. Direct comparisons of the judgments of these stimuli isolated a default bias. The patients showed a greater tendency than the control subjects to rate occluded faces as more approachable than whole faces. These findings suggest that the amygdala's role in approach behavior extends beyond responses to specific stimuli.},

  abstract = {Abstract Histone hypoacetylation is associated with dopaminergic neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease (PD), because of an imbalance in the activities of the enzymes responsible for histone (de)acetylation. Correction of this imbalance, with histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibiting agents, could be neuroprotective. We therefore hypothesize that nicotinamide, being a selective inhibitor of HDAC class III as well as having modulatory effects on mitochondrial energy metabolism, would be neuroprotective in the lactacystin rat model of PD, which recapitulates the formation of neurotoxic accumulation of altered proteins within the substantia nigra to cause progressive dopaminergic cell death. Rats received nicotinamide for 28~days, starting 7~days after unilateral injection of the irreversible proteasome inhibitor, lactacystin, into the substantia nigra. Longitudinal motor behavioural testing and structural magnetic resonance imaging were used to track changes in this model of PD, and assessment of nigrostriatal integrity, histone acetylation and brain gene expression changes post-mortem used to quantify nicotinamide-induced neuroprotection. Counterintuitively, nicotinamide dose-dependently exacerbated neurodegeneration of dopaminergic neurons, behavioural deficits and structural brain changes in the lactacystin-lesioned rat. Nicotinamide treatment induced histone hyperacetylation and over-expression of numerous neurotrophic and anti-apoptotic factors in the brain, yet failed to result in neuroprotection, rather exacerbated dopaminergic pathology. These findings highlight the importance of inhibitor specificity within HDAC isoforms for therapeutic efficacy in PD, demonstrating the contrasting effects of HDAC class III inhibition upon cell survival in this animal model of the disease.

Yet current practice is to use statistical tests with an inappropriate null hypothesis of no difference, which can result in equating nonsignificant differences with significant homogeneity. Instead, we argue that researchers should begin with the initial hypothesis that the data are inconsistent with a valid research design, and provide sufficient statistical evidence in favor of a valid design. When tests are correctly specified so that difference is the null and equivalence is the alternative, the problems afflicting traditional tests are alleviated. We argue that equivalence tests are better able to incorporate substantive considerations about what constitutes good balance on covariates and placebo outcomes than traditional tests. We demonstrate these advantages with applications to natural experiments.},

We hypothesized that pain would occur at a lesser degree of head rotation when visual feedback overstated true rotation and at a greater degree of rotation when visual feedback understated true rotation. Our hypothesis was clearly supported: When vision overstated the amount of rotation, pain occurred at 7\% less rotation than under conditions of accurate visual feedback, and when vision understated rotation, pain occurred at 6\% greater rotation than under conditions of accurate visual feedback. We concluded that visual-proprioceptive information modulated the threshold for movement-evoked pain, which suggests that stimuli that become associated with pain can themselves trigger pain.},

  abstract = {Abstract The symptomologies of Alzheimer's disease (AD) develop over decades suggesting modifiable lifestyle factors may contribute to disease pathogenesis. In humans, hyperinsulinemia associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus increases the risk for developing AD and both diseases share similar age-related etiologies including amyloidogenesis. Since we have demonstrated that soluble A?42 elicits glutamate release, we wanted to understand how diet-induced insulin resistance alters hippocampal glutamate dynamics, which are important for memory formation and consolidation. Eight to twelve-week-old C57BL/6J and A?PP/PS1 mice were placed on either a low-fat diet or high-fat diet (HFD) for 8~months. A HFD led to significant weight increases as well as impaired insulin sensitivity, glucose tolerance, and learning in both C57BL/6J and A?PP/PS1 mice. A?PP/PS1 low-fat diet mice had elevated hippocampal basal as well as stimulus-evoked glutamate release that was further increased with consumption of a HFD. Immunohistochemistry indicated an increase in vesicular glutamate transporter 1 and glial fibrillary acidic protein density in hippocampal subregions corresponding with this elevated extracellular glutamate. While no differences in hippocampal plaque load were observed, the elevated astrogliotic response surrounding the plaques in A?PP/PS1 HFD mice may have been a compensatory mechanism to control plaque accumulation. These data support that A?PP/PS1 mice have chronically elevated extracellular glutamate that is exacerbated by a HFD and that modifiable lifestyle factors such as obesity-induced insulin resistance can contribute to AD pathogenesis.

Using candidate demographic data at the congressional level and measures of party support for primary candidates, we test whether parties discriminate against women and minority candidates in congressional primaries and also whether parties are strategic in their support of minority candidates in certain primaries. Our findings show parties are not biased against minority candidates and also that white women candidates receive more support from the Democratic Party than do other types of candidates. Our findings also suggest that parties do not appear to strategically support minority candidates in districts with larger populations of minorities. Lastly, we also find no significant differences in the effects of party support on the likelihood of success in the primary by candidate race or gender.},

However, the process by which a physical handshape is mentally transformed into abstract spatial information is not well understood. We present a series of experiments that investigate how people decode the physical form of an articulator to derive imaginary geometrical constructs, which we call ``gesture form.'' We provide quantitative evidence for several key properties that play a role in this process. First, ``profiling,'' the ability to focus on a structural subunit within the complex form of the physical hand. Second, ``perspective,'' for which we show that one and the same handshape seen from different perspectives can lead to different spatial interpretations. Third, ``selectivity,'' the fact that gestures focus on specific spatial features at the expense of others. Our results provide a first step toward mapping out the process of how representational gestures make the communication of spatial information possible.},

We empirically address this question using data from two panel studies and one nationally representative study, and find consistent evidence supporting the hypothesis that ideology predicts moral intuitions.

Overall, we find those on the left and right are equally narcissistic. However, liberals and conservatives differ in which dimensions drive their narcissism. Specifically, we find that the entitlement facet of narcissism is uniformly related to more conservative positions, whereas exhibitionism is related to more liberal values, including political party identification. Narcissism, as a complex multidimensional construct, has an important role in understanding political ideology.},

Effects of non-sphericity in the population on Type I error were also inspected: 5,000 random samples were drawn from two populations containing neither a within-subject nor a between-group effect. They were analyzed including the most common options to correct rANOVA and MLM-results: The Huynh-Feldt-correction for rANOVA (rANOVA-HF) and the Kenward-Roger-correction for MLM (MLM-KR), which could help to correct progressive bias of MLM with an unstructured covariance matrix (MLM-UN). Moreover, uncorrected rANOVA and MLM assuming a compound symmetry covariance structure (MLM-CS) were also taken into account. The results showed a progressive bias for MLM-UN for small samples which was stronger in SPSS than in SAS. Moreover, an appropriate bias correction for Type I error via rANOVA-HF and an insufficient correction by MLM-UN-KR for n {$<$} 30 were found. These findings suggest MLM-CS or rANOVA if sphericity holds and a correction of a violation via rANOVA-HF. If an analysis requires MLM, SPSS yields more accurate Type I error rates for MLM-CS and SAS yields more accurate Type I error rates for MLM-UN.},

A wide range of both internally and externally directed behavioral strategies may serve to protect well-being among caregivers. Specifically, primary control strategies involve direct attempts to change one's current situation, while secondary control strategies are attempts to inwardly adjust cognitions to align with the current situation. This study examined the use of multiple primary and secondary control strategies among familial caregivers (n = 110), as well as their associations with several indices of psychological well-being. Results showed that the most common primary and secondary control strategies, namely task persistence and positive reappraisal, were used with approximately equal frequency. Furthermore, the specific strategy of positive reappraisal seemed to bolster psychological well-being among caregivers. Findings indicate that primary control strategies might be less effective than secondary control strategies within the context of caregiving for a person with dementia.},

We hypothesized that children with an older sister have better language abilities than children with an older brother, especially when there is a large age gap between the two siblings. We reanalyzed data from the EDEN cohort (N = 1,154) and found that children with an older sister had better language skills than those with an older brother. Contrary to predictions, results showed that the age gap between siblings was not associated with language skills and did not interact with sex. Results suggest that the negative effect of older siblings on language development may be entirely due to the role of older brothers. Our findings invite further research on the mechanisms involved in this effect.},

  abstract = {Objectives
Psychopathy is associated with severe forms of antisocial and violent behavior in adults. There is also a rapidly growing body of research focused on extending features of adult psychopathy downward to youth. To date however, the degree to which these features can be consistently and comparatively assessed at these younger ages, remains unclear. This study addresses this issue by investigating measurement invariance of underlying features of psychopathy across childhood and adolescence in a racially diverse sample of youth.
Methods
Three cohorts of youth (n = 1517) were assessed annually from childhood to adolescence (ages  {$\sim$}7\textendash 16). Underlying features of psychopathy commonly assessed in youth (e.g. lack of guilt, impulsivity) were examined within a longitudinal bi-factor framework using multi-dimensional item-response theory (IRT) techniques. Differential item functioning was used to assess invariance across development and participant's race (African-American and Caucasian), using two distinct approaches: (1) traditional item-response theory (IRT) methods; and (2) a recently developed Bayesian structural equation modeling (BSEM) approach.
Results
Psychopathy features assessed in this study exhibited measurement consistency across development ({$\sim$}ages 7\textendash 16) and were found to tap into the same underlying construct as intended across measurement occasions, and equivalently for African-American and Caucasian youth. Results were similar when assessed using traditional IRT procedures for longitudinal invariance testing and when implementing the more recent BSEM methodology.
Conclusions
Findings provide the first evidence that features of psychopathy can be assessed consistently in youth and improve our understanding of important developmental and sociocultural factors associated these features during earlier periods of development.},

On the other hand, use of a foreign language might stunt emotional processing, attenuating considerations of deontological rules, such as the prohibition against killing. Using a process-dissociation technique, we found that foreign-language use decreases deontological responding but does not increase utilitarian responding. This suggests that using a foreign language affects moral choice not through increased deliberation but by blunting emotional reactions associated with the violation of deontological rules.},

Although numerous studies support this theoretical process model, no research to date has ever found that DTA mediates the effect of MS in a single study, using the measurement-of-mediation approach. In this paper, we argue that the lack of evidence for this effect is due to methodological issues associated with the measurement of DTA. Specifically, measuring DTA primes death-thoughts and thereby disrupts the psychological processes that are typically initiated by MS. We provide evidence for this theorizing in three studies. Study 1 shows that merely administering a DTA task (vs. a neutral non-death-related task) increases distal self-esteem enhancement following a delay period (cf., a typical MS effect). Study 2 is a preregistered replication of Study 1, and found parallel effects, but only among participants who did not speed through the study. Study 3 demonstrates that whereas MS increases self-enhancement after a delay when DTA is not measured, administering a DTA task following MS eliminates this effect. Implications for understanding the implicit processes initiated in response to MS are discussed, and methodological recommendations for conducting empirically sound MS studies are suggested.},

This paper presents a hydrological and micrometeorological dataset collected in the Scotty Creek basin, Northwest Territories, Canada over the period of 01 October 2014 to 30 September 2015, a sample of the intensive and coordinated measurements collected annually at this site. Micrometeorological data collected from four stations, one located in each of the land cover types representative of those comprising the Scotty Creek basin including bog, channel fen, stable peat plateau and peat plateau undergoing rapid permafrost degradation and loss, are presented. Monitored micrometeorological variables include incoming and outgoing shortwave and longwave radiation, air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, precipitation (rain and snow) and snow depth. Deep ground temperatures ( 1\textendash 10 m below the ground surface) from a channel fen as well as disturbed sites common to the basin including a seismic line and winter road are presented. Water levels were also monitored in the representative land cover types over this period. This dataset is available from the Wilfrid Laurier University Library Research Data Repository (https://doi.org/10.5683/SP/OQDRJG) and can be used in coordination with other hydrological and micrometeorological datasets to examine spatio-temporal effects of meteorological conditions on local hydrological responses across cold regions.},

  abstract = {Conventional models of bargaining and reassurance under incomplete information assume that actors' behavioral signals are objectively cooperative or noncooperative. Even if actors are uncertain of each other's preferences, they know what types of actions the other will view as cooperative. Yet on many real-world issues, cooperation is subjective, and what constitutes a cooperative action is conditional on the receiver's preferences. We present a formal model showing that in these cases, two-sided incomplete information actually incentivizes honest behavior and facilitates credible signaling. Because uncertain senders do not know whether a particular action will be interpreted as cooperative, they have little incentive to misrepresent, and instead honestly pursue their true goals. Thus, where cooperation is subjective, mutual uncertainty is ``offsetting,'' such that credible signals allow actors to quickly and accurately update their beliefs. We illustrate this logic through a case study of the Sino\textendash Soviet split, and highlight the model's implications for contemporary U.S.\textendash China relations.},

  abstract = {Single-digit multiplications are mainly solved by memory retrieval. However, these problems are also prone to errors due to systematic interference (i.e., co-activation of interconnected but incorrect solutions). Semantic control processes are crucial to overcome this type of interference and to retrieve the correct information. Previous research suggests the importance of several brain regions such as the left inferior frontal cortex and the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) for semantic control. But, this evidence is mainly based on tasks measuring interference during the processing of lexico-semantic information (e.g.,~pictures or words). Here, we investigated whether semantic control during arithmetic problem solving (i.e., multiplication fact retrieval) draws upon similar or different brain mechanisms as in other semantic domains (i.e., lexico-semantic). The brain activity of 46 students was measured with fMRI while participants performed an operand-related-lure (OR) and a picture-word (PW) task. In the OR task participants had to verify the correctness of a given solution to a single-digit multiplication. Similarly, in the PW task, participants had to judge whether a presented word matches the concept displayed in a picture or not. Analyses showed that resolving interference in these two tasks modulates the activation of a widespread fronto-parietal network (e.g., left/right IFG, left insula lobe, left IPS). Importantly, conjunction analysis revealed a neural overlap in the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) pars triangularis and left IPS. Additional Bayesian analyses showed that regions that are thought to store lexico-semantic information (e.g., left middle temporal gyrus) did not show evidence for an arithmetic interference effect. Overall, our findings not only indicate that semantic control plays an important role in arithmetic problem solving but also that it is supported by common brain regions across semantic domains. Additionally, by conducting Bayesian analysis we confirmed the hypothesis that the semantic control network contributes differently to semantic tasks of various domains.},

This perception appears driven by the view that changes to widely shared moral beliefs would alter friendships and that this change in social relationships would, in turn, alter an individual's personal identity. Because reasoning about identity changes substantially during adolescence, the current work tested pre- and post-adolescents to reveal the role that such changes could play in moral cognition. Experiment 1 showed that 8- to 10-year-olds, like adults, judged that people would change more after changes to their widely shared moral beliefs (e.g., whether hitting is wrong) than after changes to controversial moral beliefs (e.g., whether telling prosocial lies is wrong). Following up on this basic effect, a second experiment examined whether participants regard all changes to widely shared moral beliefs as equally impactful. Adults, but not children, reported that individuals would change more if their good moral beliefs (e.g., it is not okay to hit) transformed into bad moral beliefs (e.g., it is okay to hit) than if the opposite change occurred. This difference in adults was mediated by perceptions of how much changes to each type of belief would alter friendships. We discuss implications for moral judgment and social cognitive development.},

Four- and 5-year-olds, but not                     3-year-olds, reported lower certainty for incorrect and weaker memories than for                     correct and stronger memories, and they judiciously excluded their least                     confident memories, which resulted in accuracy gains for selected memories;                     these findings highlight age-related improvements in introspection on memory                     accuracy. Among accurate responses only, even 3-year-olds excluded their least                     confident answers, which suggests that the connection between uncertainty and                     decision making precedes the ability to monitor memory accuracy.},

In pilot studies (pooled N~=~794), we identified self-regulatory strategies from self-reports and generated hypotheses about individual differences in trait self-control predicting their use. Next, deploying ambulatory assessment (N~=~264, 1940 reports of aversive/challenging activities), we investigated predictors of the strategies' self-reported use and effectiveness (trait self-control and demand types). The popularity of strategies varied across demands. In addition, people higher in trait self-control were more likely to focus on the positive consequences of a given activity, set goals, and use emotion regulation. Focusing on positive consequences, focusing on negative consequences (of not performing the activity), thinking of the near finish, and emotion regulation increased perceived self-regulatory success across demands, whereas distracting oneself from the aversive activity decreased it. None of these strategies, however, accounted for the beneficial effects of trait self-control on perceived self-regulatory success. Hence, trait self-control and strategy use appear to represent separate routes to good self-regulation. By considering trait- and process-approaches these findings promote a more comprehensive understanding of self-regulatory success and failure during people's daily attempts to regulate their persistence. ? 2018 European Association of Personality Psychology},

  abstract = {Tourette syndrome is a neuropsychiatric developmental disorder, characterized by tics that are often preceded by an increasingly uncomfortable urge to move. Tic frequency can increase when patients pay attention to their tics, if tics are not suppressed. This study investigates how attentions modulates urge intensity, tic frequency and arousal during free ticcing and tic suppression. Tic frequency (video recording), urge intensity (rating scale) and pupil width (pupillometry as a measure of arousal) were assessed in 23 patients with Tourette syndrome (mean age 33.48~{$\pm~$}12.37; 14 male) during five attention conditions: 1) baseline, 2) watching own tics in a live video-feedback, 3) watching own tics in a previously recorded video, 4) thinking about situations that can trigger tics and 5) thinking about specific, non-tic related stimuli (distraction condition) during: a) free ticcing and b) tic suppression tic states. Urge intensity and tic frequency increased in the free ticcing condition when patients viewed their own tics live and when they thought about tic-triggering situations. In the tic suppression condition, tic frequency increased when patients watched a video of their tics, thought about their tics or were distracted. Pupil width increased significantly during the live feedback and the video condition compared to baseline in both tic states. Paying attention to own tics can be detrimental when tics are not suppressed. In contrast, paying attention to other stimuli appears detrimental when tics are suppressed, as would be the case during most current behavioural therapy techniques. However, results point to high emotional arousal and patients feeling uncomfortable when seeing themselves tic. The results also suggest that urge intensity is modulated by changes in attention in the same manner as tics and may drive change in tic frequency during free ticcing.},

Nine experiments provide support for promiscuous condemnation: the general tendency to assume that ambiguous actions are immoral. Both cognitive and functional arguments support the idea of promiscuous condemnation.

Functionally, assuming that ambiguous actions are immoral helps people quickly identify potential harm and provide aid to others.

In the last two experiments, participants showed greater promiscuous condemnation under time pressure, suggesting an automatic tendency to assume immorality that people must effortfully control.},

These models seek to infer word representations from large text collections by predicting target words from neighbouring words (or vice versa). The resulting representations are vectors in a continuous space, collectively called word embeddings. Although psychological plausibility was not a primary concern for the developers of predictive models, it has been the topic of several recent studies in the field of psycholinguistics. That is, word embeddings have been linked to similarity ratings, word associations, semantic priming, word recognition latencies, and so on. Here, we build on this work by investigating category structure. Throughout seven experiments, we sought to predict human typicality judgements from two languages, Dutch and English, using different semantic spaces. More specifically, we extracted a number of predictor variables, and evaluated how well they could capture the typicality gradient of common categories (e.g., birds, fruit, vehicles, etc.). Overall, the performance of predictive models was rather modest and did not compare favourably with that of an older count-based model. These results are somewhat disappointing given the enthusiasm surrounding predictive models. Possible explanations and future directions are discussed.},

  abstract = {People have been shown to link particular sounds with particular shapes. For instance, the round-sounding nonword bouba tends to be associated with curved shapes, whereas the sharp-sounding nonword kiki is deemed to be related to angular shapes. People's tendency to associate sounds and shapes has been observed across different languages. In the present study, we reexamined the claim by Hung, Styles, and Hsieh (2017) that such sound\textendash shape mappings can occur before an individual becomes aware of the visual stimuli. More precisely, we replicated their first experiment, in which congruent and incongruent stimuli (e.g., bouba presented in a round shape or an angular shape, respectively) were rendered invisible through continuous flash suppression. The results showed that congruent combinations, on average, broke suppression faster than incongruent combinations, thus providing converging evidence for Hung and colleagues' assertions. Collectively, these findings now provide a solid basis from which to explore the boundary conditions of the effect.},

  abstract = {A strong predisposition to engage in sexual intercourse likely evolved in humans because sex is crucial to reproduction. Given that meeting interpersonal preferences tends to promote positive relationship evaluations, sex within a relationship should be positively associated with relationship satisfaction. Nevertheless, prior research has been inconclusive in demonstrating such a link, with longitudinal and experimental studies showing no association between sexual frequency and relationship satisfaction. Crucially, though, all prior research has utilized explicit reports of satisfaction, which reflect deliberative processes that may override the more automatic implications of phylogenetically older evolved preferences. Accordingly, capturing the implications of sexual frequency for relationship evaluations may require implicit measurements that bypass deliberative reasoning. Consistent with this idea, one cross-sectional and one 3-year study of newlywed couples revealed a positive association between sexual frequency and automatic partner evaluations but not explicit satisfaction. These findings highlight the importance of automatic measurements to understanding interpersonal relationships.},

Whereas the Honesty\textendash Humility dimension from the HEXACO model of personality has been identified as a consistent predictor of cooperation, the underlying motivational mechanisms of this association have remained unclear\textemdash especially given the confound between the temptation to exploit others and the fear of being exploited as motivational drivers of defection in social dilemmas. In a reanalysis and a new experiment, we tease apart these mechanisms by manipulating the rank order of pay-offs in a symmetric two-person game paradigm, essentially implementing the classic prisoner's dilemma, stag hunt, and chicken games. Results revealed that Honesty\textendash Humility predicted cooperation specifically in the games in which temptation was a potential motivator of defection, whereas it did not account for cooperation in those games in which only fear implied defection. Our findings thereby shed light on the underlying motivational mechanisms of the Honesty\textendash Humility\textendash cooperation link and, more generally, demonstrate how economic games can be used to disentangle such mechanisms.

The ease with which these mental images are created belies the complexity of three-dimensional body shapes. We explored the relationship between body shapes and body descriptions and showed that a small number of words can be used to generate categorically accurate representations of three-dimensional bodies. The dimensions of body-shape variation that emerged in a language-based similarity space were related to major dimensions of variation computed directly from three-dimensional laser scans of 2,094 bodies. This relationship allowed us to generate three-dimensional models of people in the shape space using only their coordinates on analogous dimensions in the language-based description space. Human descriptions of photographed bodies and their corresponding models matched closely. The natural mapping between the spaces illustrates the role of language as a concise code for body shape that captures perceptually salient global and local body features.},

Across three studies, we measured (Study 1) or manipulated (Studies 2 and 3) participants' energy need and gave them the opportunity to eat provided snacks. Participants also reported their SES during childhood and their current SES. Results revealed that people who grew up in high-SES environments regulated their food intake on the basis of their immediate energy need; they ate more when their need was high than when their need was low. This relationship was not observed among people who grew up in low-SES environments. These individuals consumed comparably high amounts of food when their current energy need was high and when it was low. Childhood SES may have a lasting impact on food regulation.},

These comparisons generally suggest poor representation. We argue here that this common design is unlikely to effectively evaluate representation because responses to survey questions differ in important aspects from voting in legislatures. Measurement error and construct validity undermine the comparison. Three survey experiments show that providing partisan and nonpartisan information readily available to legislators materially changes respondents' expressed preferences on roll-call votes. With information, expressed policy positions are both less centrist and more closely matched to legislator behavior in their preferred party. Respondents also appear aware of their own lack of knowledge in evaluating roll-call policy votes. The treatment effect of information decreases in confidence judging policy in that area. We show similar patterns for respondent opinions on Supreme Court decisions.},

Consequently, we hypothesized that increased depressive severity would counterintuitively be associated with reduced negativity ratings for retrieved personal memories to positive cues on the NAMT.

Results demonstrated that relative to never-depressed controls, individuals with MDD experience reduced recall of both specific (d = 0.48) and general memories (d = 1.00) along with reduced flexibility in alternating between specific and general memories (d = 0.90).

  abstract = {The increasing availability of software with which to estimate multivariate multilevel models (also called multilevel structural equation models) makes it easier than ever before to leverage these powerful techniques to answer research questions at multiple levels of analysis simultaneously. However, interpretation can be tricky given that different choices for centering model predictors can lead to different versions of what appear to be the same parameters; this is especially the case when the predictors are latent variables created through model-estimated variance components. A further complication is a recent change to Mplus (Version 8.1), a popular software program for estimating multivariate multilevel models, in which the selection of Bayesian estimation instead of maximum likelihood results in different lower-level predictors when random slopes are requested. This article provides a detailed explication of how the parameters of multilevel models differ as a function of the analyst's decisions regarding centering and the form of lower-level predictors (i.e., observed or latent), the method of estimation, and the variant of program syntax used. After explaining how different methods of centering lower-level observed predictor variables result in different higher-level effects within univariate multilevel models, this article uses simulated data to demonstrate how these same concepts apply in specifying multivariate multilevel models with latent lower-level predictor variables. Complete data, input, and output files for all of the example models have been made available online to further aid readers in accurately translating these central tenets of multivariate multilevel modeling into practice.},

  abstract = {Sexual assault is a pervasive problem on college campuses. Federal laws have shaped policies addressing sexual assault in higher education. Title IX guidance requires universities to designate ``Responsible Employees,'' who are required to report all sexual assaults they learn about to the university (even if the survivor does not want to report). Resident assistants (RAs) are an important source of support for students and increasingly designated as Responsible Employees. University mandatory reporting policies have significant implications for reporters' and survivors' lives, but there is a lack of research on how Responsible Employees perceive this role. The current study examined Responsible Employee RA perceptions of mandatory reporting, the relationship between RAs' experience of college sexual assault and perceptions of mandatory reporting, and whether trust in university response to sexual assault mediates this relationship. Data from 305 Responsible Employee RAs were analyzed. RAs' perceptions of their reporting role were varied. For instance, RAs believed that mandatory reporting complicates their other responsibilities. College sexual assault survivors had less trust in university response to sexual assault, which, in turn, predicted more negative perceptions of mandatory reporting. Responsible Employees' perceptions of mandatory reporting offer valuable insight into the potential effectiveness and drawbacks of these policies.},

Strikingly, however, these patients can nevertheless show a preservation in their ability to recognize real-world objects \textendash a phenomenon known as the `real-object advantage' (ROA) in agnosia. To uncover the mechanisms that support the ROA, patients were asked to identify objects whose size was congruent or incongruent with typical real-world size, presented in different display formats (real objects, 2-D and 3-D images). While recognition of images was extremely poor, real object recognition was surprisingly preserved, but only when physical size matched real-world size. Analogous display format and size manipulations did not influence the recognition of common geometric shapes that lacked real-world size associations. These neuropsychological data provide evidence for a surprising preservation of size-coding of real-world-sized tangible objects in patients for whom ventral contributions to image processing are severely disrupted. We propose that object size information is largely mediated by dorsal visual cortex and that this information, together with detailed representation of object shape which is also subserved by dorsal cortex, serve as the basis of the~ROA.},

The dataset interpolates in situ observations to a regular grid using methods developed in a previous equivalent dataset that had been made available to users since 2002 through the UK Climate Projections project (UKCIP02, UKCP09). The new dataset differs from the existing one in a number of key respects: higher spatial resolution, longer time series for some variables, improved consistency with regard to the pre-processing of station observations, the use of publicly-accessible ancillary data sources, a revised calculation sequence for some variables and improved version control. This makes for a dataset that is more internally consistent, more traceable and more reproducible. The result is a dataset of key UK climate variables of up to 1 km resolution from 1862 for monthly rainfall, 1884 for monthly temperature, 1891 for daily rainfall, 1929 for monthly sunshine and a wider set of variables with start dates from the 1960s to support the need for national climate monitoring and climate research.},

  abstract = {Abstract Lactate's role in the brain is understood as a contributor to brain energy metabolism, but it may also regulate the cerebral microcirculation. The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate evidence of lactate as a physiological effector within the normal cerebral microcirculation in reports ranging from in~vitro experiments to in~vivo studies in animals and humans. Following pre-registration of a review protocol, we systematically searched the PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases for literature covering themes of ?lactate?, ?the brain?, and ?microcirculation?. Abstracts were screened, and data extracted independently by two individuals. We excluded studies evaluating lactate in disease models. Twenty-eight papers were identified, 18 of which were in~vivo animal experiments (65\%), four on human studies (14\%), and six on in~vitro or ex~vivo experiments (21\%). Approximately half of the papers identified lactate as an augmenter of the hyperemic response to functional activation by a visual stimulus or as an instigator of hyperemia in a dose-dependent manner, without external stimulation. The mechanisms are likely to be coupled to NAD+/NADH redox state influencing the production of nitric oxide. Unfortunately, only 38\% of these studies demonstrated any control for bias, which makes reliable generalizations of the conclusions insecure. This systematic review identifies that lactate may act as a dose-dependent regulator of cerebral microcirculation by augmenting the hyperemic response to functional activation below 5~mmol/kg, and by initiating a hyperemic response above 5~mmol/kg.

  abstract = {Archaeology is defined by its grounding in material objects; without contextual elements of space and place, however, material culture is devoid of much of its meaning and archaeological information. This article focuses upon pre-Columbian objects  including gold, ceramics, and stone artefacts  from a small, localised area of the Chiriqui region of western Panama in the context of the volcanic landscape. The discussion is intended as a provocative introduction to the archaeology of highland Chiriqui rather than an exhaustive exploration, and seeks to convey the contemporary context of an understudied archaeological region. Chiriqui, like the isthmus of Panama overall, inhabits a nebulous place in archaeological conception due to its positioning below Mesoamerica and above the Andean world. This academic displacement is further complicated  or potentially prompted  by the de-contextualisation of vast quantities of pre-Columbian artefacts in the late 19th century, after large cemeteries were discovered in 1859 and then subjected to several decades of intensive excavation by individuals seeking monetary gain, adventure, or both from the experience. Antiquities removed from Chiriqui at this time were transported to museum collections throughout the western world. While the removed artefacts attest to the richness of pre-Columbian material culture, the sites from which they came were effectively erased from the landscape and archaeological conception. I draw from diverse, ephemeral and cartographically imprecise sources of information provided by accounts from looters and adventurers, antiquarian reports, museum accession files, and rumour to extrapolate possible locations for looted sites that provided the materials held in the major museum collections. I place these 'un-firm' locations in a GIS in conjunction with precisely located sites from systematic survey to show how they relate to one another. A concomitant role of this article is to make data from fieldwork I conducted between 2000 and 2005 in highland Chiriqui accessible to other researchers. In this article, I tease out one particular grave and the materials used to construct it from these data as synecdoche for myriad thousands of looted Chiriqui graves as well as the archaeological need to seek new forms of data.},

After training, production-learning participants outperformed comprehension-learning participants on vocabulary comprehension and on comprehension tests of grammatical dependencies, even when we controlled for individual differences in vocabulary learning.

Across four experiments involving 489 participants, we compared two decision-making scenarios: one in which value information was revealed during sampling (standard) and one in which value information was revealed after sampling (value ignorance). On average, participants made riskier choices when value information was provided after sampling. Moreover, parameter estimates from a hierarchical Bayesian implementation of cumulative-prospect theory suggested that participants overweighted rare events when value information was absent during sampling but did not overweight such events in the standard condition. This suggests that the impact of rare events on choice relies crucially on the timing of probability and value integration. We provide paths toward mechanistic explanations of our results based on frameworks that assume different underlying cognitive architectures.},

At the same time, in everyday contexts, situations in which a verb is heard will be interrupted by distracting events. Using Structural Alignment theory as a framework, Study 1 asks whether children can learn a verb when irrelevant, interleaved events are present. Two{$\frac{1}{2}$}- and 3{$\frac{1}{2}$}-year-old children saw dynamic events and were randomly assigned to one of three experimental conditions (differing in orders of events) or one of two control conditions. They extended the verbs in the experimental conditions, and not the control conditions. Three {$\frac{1}{2}$}-year-olds were more successful than 2{$\frac{1}{2}$}-year-olds, though the younger children could extend verbs. A more difficult task is segmenting dynamic action into subevents that could be relevant for a verb (e.g., finding ``chopping'' in a cooking scene). In Study 2, 2{$\frac{1}{2}$}-, 3{$\frac{1}{2}$}-, and 4{$\frac{1}{2}$}-year-old children were assigned to experimental conditions in which relevant events flowed into irrelevant events (or vice versa) or to a control. Two{$\frac{1}{2}$}-year-olds failed to extend the verbs at test, differing from the older children; children in experimental conditions extended the verbs while children in the control condition did not. Altogether, these results show children can ignore irrelevant events (and subevents), and extend new verbs by 3{$\frac{1}{2}$} years. Results are important to understand learning in everyday contexts in which verbs are heard in varied situations over time.},

How do listeners revise misinterpretations of language input moment by moment to avoid comprehension errors? Cognitive control may play a role by detecting when processing has gone awry and then initiating behavioral adjustments accordingly. However, no research to date has investigated a cause-and-effect interplay between cognitive-control engagement and the overriding of erroneous interpretations in real time. Using a novel cross-task paradigm, we showed that Stroop-conflict detection, which mobilizes cognitive-control procedures, subsequently facilitates listeners' incremental processing of temporarily ambiguous spoken instructions that induce brief misinterpretation. When instructions followed incongruent Stroop items, compared with congruent Stroop items, listeners' eye movements to objects in a scene reflected more transient consideration of the false interpretation and earlier recovery of the correct one. Comprehension errors also decreased. Cognitive-control engagement therefore accelerates sentence-reinterpretation processes, even as linguistic input is still unfolding.},

Participants rated personality traits for male and female bodies generated with a three-dimensional body model. Multivariate spaces created from these ratings indicated that people evaluate bodies on valence and agency in ways that directly contrast positive and negative traits from the Big Five domains. Body-trait stereotypes based on the trait ratings revealed a myriad of diverse body shapes that typify individual traits. Personality-trait profiles were predicted reliably from a subset of the body-shape features used to specify the three-dimensional bodies. Body features related to extraversion and conscientiousness were predicted with the highest consensus, followed by openness traits. This study provides the first comprehensive look at the range, diversity, and reliability of personality inferences that people make from body shapes.},

Participants encoded sensorimotor-rich memories by enacting a lab-based crime (stealing a ring) and received instructions to suppress memory of the crime in order to evade guilt detection in a brain-wave-based concealed-information test. Aftereffects of suppression on automatic memory processes were measured in an autobiographical Implicit Association Test. Results showed that suppression attenuated brain-wave activity (the P300) associated with crime-relevant memory retrieval, which rendered waveforms from innocent and guilty participants indistinguishable. However, the two groups could nevertheless be discriminated via the late-posterior-negative slow wave, which may reflect the need to monitor response conflict arising between voluntary suppression and automatic recognition processes. Finally, extending recent findings that suppression can impair implicit memory processes, we provide novel evidence that suppression reduces automatic cognitive biases often associated with actual autobiographical memories.},

  abstract = {Inflammatory pain is associated with peripheral and central sensitization, but the underlying synaptic plasticity at the spinal cord level is poorly understood. Transient receptor potential (TRP) channels expressed at peripheral nerve endings, including TRP subtypes ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) and vanilloid 1 (TRPV1), can detect nociceptive stimuli. In this study, we determined the contribution of presynaptic TRPA1 and TRPV1 at the spinal cord level to regulating nociceptive drive in chronic inflammatory pain induced by complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) in rats. CFA treatment caused a large increase in the frequency of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) in lamina I, but not lamina II outer zone, dorsal horn neurons. However, blocking NMDA receptors had no effect on spontaneous EPSCs in lamina I neurons of CFA-treated rats. Application of a specific TRPA1 antagonist, AM-0902, or of a specific TRPV1 antagonist, 5{${'}$}-iodoresiniferatoxin, significantly attenuated the elevated frequency of spontaneous EPSCs and miniature EPSCs, the amplitude of monosynaptic EPSCs evoked from the dorsal root in lamina I neurons of CFA-treated rats. AM-0902 and 5{${'}$}-iodoresiniferatoxin had no effect on evoked or miniature EPSCs in lamina I neurons of vehicle-treated rats. In addition, intrathecal injection of AM-0902 or 5{${'}$}-iodoresiniferatoxin significantly reduced pain hypersensitivity in CFA-treated rats but had no effect on acute nociception in vehicle-treated rats. Therefore, unlike neuropathic pain, chronic inflammatory pain is associated with NMDA receptor\textendash independent potentiation in glutamatergic drive to spinal lamina I neurons. Endogenous presynaptic TRPA1 and TRPV1 activity at the spinal level contributes to increased nociceptive input from primary sensory nerves to dorsal horn neurons in inflammatory pain.

Previous research has suggested that this gestural advantage might hold only for gestures that overlap with the semantics of the words. Dual coding theory predicts that learners should learn input better when multiple sensory routes act as aids to retrieval. Our research replicated and extended previous studies examining the limits of gestures in learning L2 vocabulary. A within-participant design directly compared the effects of pairing low idiosyncratic gestures (gestures traditionally iconic with word meanings) versus high idiosyncratic gestures (gestures that likely need to be idiosyncratically paired with word meanings) with L2 vocabulary presentation, relative to using no gestures. Results supported dual coding theory: All gestures were helpful if they were not confusable with other to-be-learned words and if the number of words presented was limited.

  abstract = {Repeated stimulus processing is often associated with a reduction in neural activity, known as neural adaptation. Therefore, people are more sensitive to novelty detection but likely lose flexibility in subsequent novelty processing after detection. To demonstrate the dynamic changes in neural adaption in repeated problem-solving behaviors and test its negative influence on subsequent nonrepetitive problem-solving behaviors, we adopted a Chinese character decomposition task in this fMRI study. Participants were asked to repeatedly perform 3\textendash 5 practice problems that could be solved by the same loose chunk decomposition (LCD) solution followed by a test problem that could be solved by a tight chunk decomposition (TCD) solution in the enhanced-set condition. The practice problem gradually elicited lower percent signal changes within the cuneus, superior parietal lobule (SPL), inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in serial positions -1, -2 and -3 of a set, implying that neural adaptation occurred in repeated practice. Both the test problem and the practice problem that following it recruited greater activation of the SPL and IFG in the enhanced-set condition than in the base-set condition when the practice problem and test problem alternately appeared, implying that the task switching cost from a more dominant task to a less dominant task and vice versa was increased after neural adaptation occurred. In other words, repeatedly solving a set of similar problems with the same solution likely leads to neural adaptation and cognitive inflexibility, which in turn have an undifferentiated impact on task switching. This finding expands existing knowledge about the neurocognitive mechanism underlying the formation of the mental set and sheds light on the influence of neural adaptation on subsequent processing.},

People's willingness and capacity to empathize, however, is often contingent upon the target's group membership \textendash{} people are less empathic towards those they categorize as out-group members. In competitive or threatening intergroup contexts, people may even feel pleasure (counter-empathy) in response to out-group members' misfortunes. Social dominance orientation (SDO), or the extent to which people prefer and promote group-based inequalities, is an ideological variable that is associated with a competitive view of the world, increased prejudicial attitudes, and decreased empathy. Thus, higher levels of SDO should be associated with reduced empathy and increased counter-empathy in general, but especially towards those whose subjugation maintains group inequalities. Across three studies we show that among White individuals, higher SDO levels are associated with less empathy, and more counter-empathy in response to others' good and bad fortunes. More importantly, these reductions in empathy and increases in schadenfreude as a function of SDO were significantly stronger for Asian and Black targets than for in-group White targets when group boundaries were made salient prior to the empathy ratings. Finally, in a fourth study we show that this phenomenon is not dependent upon a history of status differences: higher SDO scores were associated with decreased empathy and increased counter-empathy for competitive out-group (relative to in-group) targets in a novel group setting. We discuss implications of these effects for hierarchy maintenance.},

We have shown that professional freestyle swimmers at relay positions 2 to 4 swam faster in the relay than in the individual competition if they had a high chance to win a relay medal. After applying a reaction-time correction that controls for different starting procedures in relay and individual competitions, Skorski et al. (2016) conclude that swimmers in relays do not swim faster. At first sight, their results appear to show this very pattern. However, we argue that the authors' findings and conclusion\textemdash that our finding is a myth\textemdash are not warranted. First, we have also controlled for quicker reaction times in the relay competition. Our correction has been based on the swimmers' own reaction time data rather than on a constant reaction time estimate and is, thus, more precise than theirs. Second, Skorski et al. treat data from international and national competitions equally although national relay competitions are less attractive for the swimmers than national individual competitions. This difference likely biases their data towards slower relay times. Third, the authors select a small and arbitrary sample without explicit power considerations or a clear stopping rule. Fourth, they unfavorably aggregate their data. We conclude that the reported results are most likely due to the methodological choices by Skorski et al. and do not invalidate our findings.},

Here, we found that people believe that within-category substitutes, which are more similar to desired stimuli, will more effectively satisfy their cravings than will cross-category substitutes (Experiments 1, 2a, and 2b). However, because within-category substitutes are more similar than cross-category substitutes to desired stimuli, they are more likely to evoke an unanticipated negative contrast effect. As a result, unless substitutes are equivalent in quality to the desired stimulus, cross-category substitutes more effectively satisfy cravings for the desired stimulus (Experiments 3 and 4).},

  abstract = {Embodied cognition theories propose that the semantic representations engaged in during language comprehension are partly supported by perceptual and motor systems, via simulation. Activation in modality-specific regions of cortex is associated with the comprehension of literal language that describes the analogous modalities, but studies addressing the grounding of non-literal or figurative language, such as metaphors, have yielded mixed results. Differences in the psycholinguistic characteristics of sentence stimuli across studies have likely contributed to this lack of consensus. Furthermore, previous studies have been largely correlational, whilst patient studies are a critical way of determining if intact sensorimotor function is necessary to understand language drawing on sensorimotor information. We designed a battery of metaphorical and literal sentence stimuli using action and sound words, with an unprecedented level of control over critical psycholinguistic variables, to test hypotheses about the grounding of metaphorical language. In this Registered Report, we assessed the comprehension of these sentences in 41 patients with Parkinson's disease, who were predicted to be disproportionately affected by the action sentences relative to the sound sentences, and compared their performance to that of 39 healthy age-matched controls who were predicted to show no difference in performance due to sensory modality. Using preregistered Bayesian model comparison methods, we found that PD patients' comprehension of literal action sentences was not impaired, while there was some evidence for a slowing of responses to action metaphors. Follow up exploratory analyses suggest that this response time modality effect was driven by one type of metaphor (predicate) and was absent in another (nominal), despite the fact that the action semantics were similar in both syntactic forms. These results suggest that the conditions under which PD patients demonstrate hypothesized embodiment effects are limited. We offer a critical assessment of the PD action language literature and discuss implications for the embodiment debate. In addition, we suggest how future studies could leverage Bayesian statistical methods to provide more convincing evidence for or against embodied cognition effects.},

Accordingly, we investigated the extent to which framing the very same information as either advice or anchor exerts a differential influence on quantitative judgments. Four experiments showed that although arbitrary anchors were given lower weight than advice, they nevertheless exerted a systematic impact on final judgments. Degree of integration was related to subjective confidence only in the advice condition, but not in the anchoring condition, suggesting that arbitrary anchors were not considered informative. Framing the source of advice as a human being versus as a computer did not affect our results. Only the aboutness of advice, that is, whether it targeted the focal judgment item, determined its influence on final judgments and on confidence. On the one hand, these findings speak to the (partial) sensitivity of human judges to the source and validity of advice under uncertainty. On the other hand, the persevering effect of arbitrary anchors demonstrates the dependence of judgments on unauthorized influences. Both findings together highlight the need to study advice taking from a metacognitive perspective.},

  abstract = {Evaluative conditioning (EC) is a social-cognitive research paradigm that is claimed to serve as an experimental analogue for the acquisition of attitudes towards individuals and groups. Previous research has challenged this claim by showing that the EC effect in facial stimuli is disrupted when a single feature of a face is altered. As the external validity of research paradigms is vital when generalizing findings from an experiment to the social world, the present research reconsiders this previous work in three experiments. Using faces as conditioned stimuli, we demonstrate that neither changes in viewing angle (Experiments 1 and 2), nor changes in features of the conditioned face (Experiment 3) disrupt the EC effect. The present experiments thus demonstrate that attitude acquisition by means of EC procedures generalizes to novel instances of the conditioned stimulus, signifying the adaptive value of EC effects in preparing behavior. Moreover, the present work suggests that conclusions drawn from this research paradigm can be applied to the acquisition of social attitudes.},

  abstract = {Most people can reason relatively wisely about others' social conflicts, but often struggle to do so about their own (i.e., Solomon's paradox). We suggest that true wisdom should involve the ability to reason wisely about both others' and one's own social conflicts, and we investigated the pursuit of virtue as a construct that predicts this broader capacity for wisdom. Results across two studies support prior findings regarding Solomon's paradox: Participants (N = 623) more strongly endorsed wise-reasoning strategies (e.g., intellectual humility, adopting an outsider's perspective) for resolving other people's social conflicts than for resolving their own. The pursuit of virtue (e.g., pursuing personal ideals and contributing to other people) moderated this effect of conflict type. In both studies, greater endorsement of the pursuit of virtue was associated with greater endorsement of wise-reasoning strategies for one's own personal conflicts; as a result, participants who highly endorsed the pursuit of virtue endorsed wise-reasoning strategies at similar levels for resolving their own social conflicts and resolving other people's social conflicts. Implications of these results and underlying mechanisms are explored and discussed.},

We predicted that, of those who experience chronic ostracism (feeling excluded and ignored frequently), people high in need to belong would utilize Twitter to satisfy their unmet belonging needs more than those low in need to belong. Specifically, individuals high in need to belong and chronic ostracism should use Twitter to form and maintain parasocial relationships (one-sided relationships with media figures). Participants (n = 315) completed a survey assessing their chronic ostracism experiences, dispositional need to belong, and Twitter behavior, particularly regarding potential parasocial relationship targets (n = 229). As expected, when participants reported experiencing high rates of chronic ostracism, participants high in need to belong used Twitter more than those low in need to belong, particularly following more parasocial relationship targets. Thus, maintaining parasocial relationships on Twitter may be an effective way to satisfy unmet belonging needs.},

Because other animals are crucial in helping to regulate body temperature, temperature differences likely determine how humans think about their social environment. Since 2008, the psychological literature on social thermoregulation has flourished with approximately 80 reports, ranging from economic decision-making to self-regulation. However, questions have arisen over its robustness and about underlying mechanisms, particularly in relation to differences in past relationship experiences. In this report, the authors used an inductive approach, exploring individual differences to identify items that alter the temperature-social thought relationship in a pilot (Study 1), and confirming the effects in Study 2 (total N for 1 and 2 = 366), both of which were not pre-registered. After a first review with the present journal, we preregistered our replication and successfully replicated our effects in a French sample (N = 350). Coldness (vs. warmth) makes people think about closer others when past relationship experiences were positive, while the reverse is true for negative past relationship experiences. These robust results provide future directions for the field of social thermoregulation.},

To test this hypothesis, we compared word frequencies in English texts from different time periods and found an increase in the use of causal language of about 40\% over the past two centuries. The observed increase was not attributable to general language effects or to changing semantics of causal words. We also found that there was a consistent difference between the 19th and the 20th centuries, and that the increase happened mainly in the 20th century.},

  abstract = {Sociometric status, the regard that other group members confer to an individual, is one of the most ubiquitous and behaviourally relevant attributes assigned to the person by the social environment. Despite this, its contribution to personality development has received little attention. The present three-wave longitudinal study, spanning the age range 7\textendash 13 years (n = 1222), sought to fill this gap by examining the transactional pathways between peer sociometric status (measured by peer nominations) and Five-Factor personality traits (measured by self-ratings and parent and teacher ratings). Sociometric status prospectively predicted the development of extraversion. By contrast, agreeableness and neuroticism prospectively predicted the development of sociometric status. Furthermore, individual-level stability in extraversion was associated with individual-level stability in sociometric status. The results were robust across different sources of personality ratings. We argue that peer sociometric status in the school classroom is the type of environmental effect that has potential to explain personality development. Because of its stability, broadness, and possible impact across a variety of personality processes, sociometric status can both repetitiously and simultaneously influence the network of multiple inter-correlated micro-level personality processes, potentially leading to a new network equilibrium that manifests in changes at the level of the broad personality trait. \textcopyright{} 2019 European Association of Personality Psychology},

We show that the ability of these models to adjust for unobserved time-invariant confounders comes at the expense of dynamic causal relationships, which are permitted under an alternative selection-on-observables approach. Using the nonparametric directed acyclic graph, we highlight two key causal identification assumptions of unit fixed effects models: Past treatments do not directly influence current outcome, and past outcomes do not affect current treatment. Furthermore, we introduce a new nonparametric matching framework that elucidates how various unit fixed effects models implicitly compare treated and control observations to draw causal inference. By establishing the equivalence between matching and weighted unit fixed effects estimators, this framework enables a diverse set of identification strategies to adjust for unobservables in the absence of dynamic causal relationships between treatment and outcome variables. We illustrate the proposed methodology through its application to the estimation of GATT membership effects on dyadic trade volume.},

Together these studies do not only provide important insights into the perception of one of the most ubiquitous social taxonomies but also provide a rich, open access dataset for researchers seeking to employ occupational groups as a tool to better understand stereotypes and intergroup relations in general.},

In Studies 1 and 2, Caucasian and Hong Kong Chinese participants, respectively, selected the more attractive image in pairs of high and low carotenoid colouration versions of images of Caucasian faces and body parts, and also for non-face/body-part control stimuli (scrambled faces). In Study 3, a similar study protocol was used with an independent sample of Hong Kong Chinese participants using stimuli generated from Chinese individuals. The results showed that high carotenoid colouration was preferred across all the three studies in faces and body parts, but not in the control stimuli. In addition, there was a stronger preference for high carotenoid colouration in faces compared with body parts in Studies 1 and 2\textemdash although this preference was not observed in Study 3.

  abstract = {The Implicit Association Test (IAT) is nearly synonymous with the implicit attitude construct. At the same time, correlations between the IAT and criterion measures are often remarkably low. Developed within research using explicit measures of attitudes, the correspondence principle posits that measures should better predict criteria when there is a match in terms of the level of generality or specificity at which both are conceptualized (Ajzen \& Fishbein, 1977). As such, weak implicit-criterion correlations are to be expected when broad general implicit measures are used to predict highly specific criteria. Research using explicit measures of attitudes consistently supports the correspondence principle, but conceptual correspondence is rarely considered by researchers using implicit measures to predict behavior and other relevant criterion measures. In five experiments (total N = 4650), we provide the first direct evidence demonstrating the relevance of the correspondence principle to the predictive validity of the IAT and Single-Target IAT. That said, it is not the case that the IAT always predicts criteria better when correspondence is high. Inconsistency across the pattern of results suggests there is much more that remains to be understood about the relevance of the correspondence principle to the implicit-criterion relationship. Taken together, however, our findings suggest that conceptual correspondence often increases (and never decreases) the magnitude of implicit-criterion and implicit-explicit relationships. We provide a framework for future research necessary to establish when correspondence is more likely to increase the predictive validity of measures such as the IAT.},

Little is known, however, about which empathic process actually help people recognize others' feelings more accurately. Here, we probed the relationship between emotion recognition and two empathic processes: spontaneously felt similarity (having had a similar experience) and deliberate perspective taking (focus on the other vs. oneself). We report four studies in which participants (total N = 803) watched videos of targets sharing genuine negative emotional experiences. Participants' multi-scalar ratings of the targets' emotions were compared with the targets' own emotion ratings. In Study 1 we found that having had a similar experience to what the target was sharing was associated with lower recognition of the target's emotions. Study 2 replicated the same pattern and in addition showed that making participants' own imagined reaction to the described event salient resulted in further reduced accuracy. Studies 3 and 4 were preregistered replications and extensions of Studies 1 and 2, in which we observed the same outcome using a different stimulus set, indicating the robustness of the finding. Moreover, Study 4 directly investigated the underlying mechanism of the observed effect. Findings showed that perceivers who have had a negative life experience similar to the emotional event described in the video felt greater personal distress after watching the video, which in part explained their reduced accuracy. These results provide the first demonstration that spontaneous empathy, evoked by similarity in negative experiences, may inhibit rather than increase our understanding of others' emotions.},

In Experiment 1, target and orthographic competitor words attracted more fixations than unrelated words before the target word was mentioned, suggesting that participants pre-activated orthographic form of the target word. In Experiment 2, target and phonological competitor words attracted more predictive fixations than unrelated words, but orthographic competitor words did not, suggesting a critical role of the visual context. This pre-activation pattern does not fit with the pattern of lexical activation in auditory word recognition, where orthography and phonology interact. However, it is compatible with the pattern of lexical activation in spoken word production, where orthographic information is not automatically activated, in line with production-based prediction accounts.},

  abstract = {Methodological innovations have allowed researchers to consider increasingly sophisticated statistical models that are better in line with the complexities of real-world behavioral data. However, despite these powerful new analytic approaches, sample sizes may not always be sufficiently large to deal with the increase in model complexity. This difficult modeling scenario entails large models with a limited number of observations given the number of parameters. Here, we describe a particular strategy to overcome this challenge: regularization, a method of penalizing model complexity during estimation. Regularization has proven to be a viable option for estimating parameters in this small-sample, many-predictors setting, but so far it has been used mostly in linear regression models. We show how to integrate regularization within structural equation models, a popular analytic approach in psychology. We first describe the rationale behind regularization in regression contexts and how it can be extended to regularized structural equation modeling. We then evaluate our approach using a simulation study, showing that regularized structural equation modeling outperforms traditional structural equation modeling in situations with a large number of predictors and a small sample size. Next, we illustrate the power of this approach in two empirical examples: modeling the neural determinants of visual short-term memory and identifying demographic correlates of stress, anxiety, and depression.},

Furthermore, both memory reactivation and playing Tetris were required to reduce subsequent intrusions (Experiment 2), consistent with reconsolidation-update mechanisms.

We found that toddlers can use the time and effort associated with goal-directed actions to distinguish agents, and that children prefer agents who incur fewer costs in completing a goal. When two agents refuse to help, children retain a preference for the more competent agent but infer that the less competent agent is nicer. These results suggest that children value agents who incur fewer costs, but understand that failure to engage in a low-cost action implies a lack of motivation. We propose that a naive utility calculus underlies inferences from the costs and rewards of goal-directed action and thereby supports social cognition.},

  abstract = {Abstract Vaccinia-related kinase 2 (VRK2) is a serine/threonine kinase that belongs to the casein kinase 1 family. VRK2 has long been known for its relationship with neurodegenerative disorders such as schizophrenia. However, the role of VRK2 and the substrates associated with it are unknown. Dysbindin is known as one of the strong risk factors for schizophrenia. The expression of dysbindin is indeed significantly reduced in schizophrenia patients. Moreover, dysbindin is involved in neurite outgrowth and regulation of NMDA receptor signaling. Here, we first identified dysbindin as a novel interacting protein of VRK2 through immunoprecipitation. We hypothesized that dysbindin is phosphorylated by VRK2 and further that this phosphorylation plays an important role in the function of dysbindin. We show that VRK2 phosphorylates Ser 297 and Ser 299 of dysbindin using in~vitro kinase assay. In addition, we found that VRK2-mediated phosphorylation of dysbindin enhanced ubiquitination of dysbindin and consequently resulted in the decrease in its protein stability through western blotting. Over-expression of VRK2 in human neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cells reduced neurite outgrowth induced by retinoic acid. Furthermore, a phosphomimetic mutant of dysbindin alleviated neurite outgrowth and affected surface expression of N-methyl-d-aspartate 2A, a subunit of NMDA receptor in mouse hippocampal neurons. Together, our work reveals the regulation of dysbindin by VRK2, providing the association of these two proteins, which are commonly implicated in schizophrenia.

We predicted and found that prior self-control increased students' motivation for active pursuit of the academic goal. In Study 1, prior self-control reduced students' behavioral intentions for school work and non-academic activities alike when academic pursuit was not activated. Under active pursuit of the academic goal, however, prior self-control uniquely increased students' intentions for school work. In Study 2, this facilitatory effect of prior self-control on behavioral intention toward an academic goal was replicated and accompanied by positive implicit attitudes toward study-related stimuli. In Study 3, when preparing to pursue the academic goal, prior self-control increased students' tendency to proactively remove a temptation from the immediate context (leave their phone with the experimenter) to support better task performance. Our investigation illustrates the importance of examining not only the debilitating but also the potentially facilitatory effect of prior self-control exertion.},

Sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1), a key enzyme for S1P production, is concentrated in presynaptic terminals. However, the role of S1P/SphK1 signaling in exocytosis remains elusive. By detecting catecholamine release from single vesicles in chromaffin cells, we show that a dominant negative SphK1 (SphK1DN) reduces the number of amperometric spikes and increases the duration of foot, which reflects release through a fusion pore, implying critical roles for S1P in regulating the rate of exocytosis and fusion pore expansion. Similar phenotypes were observed in chromaffin cells obtained from SphK1 knockout mice compared to those from wild-type mice. In addition, extracellular S1P treatment increased the number of amperometric spikes, and this increase, in turn, was inhibited by a selective S1P3 receptor blocker, suggesting extracellular S1P may regulate the rate of exocytosis via activation of S1P3. Furthermore, intracellular S1P application induced a decrease in foot duration of amperometric spikes in control cells, indicating intracellular S1P may regulate fusion pore expansion during exocytosis. Taken together, our study represents the first demonstration that S1P regulates exocytosis through distinct mechanisms: extracellular S1P may modulate the rate of exocytosis via activation of S1P receptors while intracellular S1P may directly control fusion pore expansion during exocytosis.

This effect was partially explained by other-focused motives: Participants for whom the scenario was hypothetical anticipated less motivation to avoid hurting the potential date's feelings than participants actually felt when they believed the situation to be real. Thus, other-focused motives appear to exert an influence on mate choice that has been overlooked by researchers and laypeople alike.},

Although a state court ruled that the Board of Health did not have the authority to implement such a policy, it remains a legally viable option for governments and a voluntary option for restaurants. However, there is very limited empirical data on how such a policy might affect the purchasing and consumption of sugary drinks. We report four well-powered, incentive-compatible experiments in which we evaluated two possible ways that restaurants might comply with such a policy: bundling (i.e., dividing the contents of oversized cups into two regulation-size cups) and providing free refills (i.e., offering a regulation-size cup with unlimited refills). Bundling caused people to buy less soda. Free refills increased consumption, especially when a waiter served the refills. This perverse effect was reduced in self-service contexts that required walking just a few steps to get a refill.},

Although there is some consensus that better behavioral outcomes are achieved when activation is restored to the left hemisphere, the circumstances that dictate how and why regions in both hemispheres respond to naming therapy are still unclear. In this study, an fMRI picture-naming task was used to examine 16 regions of interest in 26 patients with chronic aphasia before and after 12 weeks of semantic naming treatment. Ten control patients who did not receive treatment and 17 healthy controls were also scanned. Naming therapy resulted in a significant increase in cortical activation, an effect that was largely driven by patients who responded most favorably to treatment, as patients who responded less favorably (as well as those who did not receive treatment) had little change in activation over time. Relative to healthy controls, patients had higher pre-treatment activation in the bilateral inferior frontal gyri (IFG) and lower activation in the bilateral angular gyri; after treatment, they had higher activation in bilateral IFG, as well as in the right middle frontal gyrus. These results suggest that the predominant effect of beneficial naming treatment was an upregulation of traditional language areas and their right hemisphere homologues and, in particular, regions associated with phonological and semantic/executive semantic processing, as well as broader domain general functions. Additionally, in some left hemisphere regions, post-treatment changes in activation were greater when there was more damage than when there was less damage, indicating that spared tissue in otherwise highly damaged regions can be modulated by treatment.},

Individual differences in the resistance to social change were related to higher levels of perceived legitimacy no matter the level of inequality of the society. Conversely, individual differences in the acceptance of inequality were related to higher levels of perceived legitimacy in unequal societies, but either a relationship near zero or the opposite relationship was found in more equal societies.

Second, to what extent do immigration status, generational status, and language use moderate beliefs about discrimination? Using Pew National Survey of Latinos data, we find that Latino beliefs about the problem of discrimination is a decreasing function of ``proximity'' to the ``canonical immigrant''\textemdash defined here as first-generation immigrants who are Spanish-language dominant. Further, we demonstrate that reported rates of victimization due to discrimination exhibit no clear pattern and are flat over time.

  abstract = {This article presents an interpretative synthesis of the development of a medieval landscape in the English Midlands. It explores its administrative organisation and divisions; the exploitation of its woodland, pasture, and arable resources; and the creation, growth, and decline of its villages, hamlets and farmsteads. It takes as its central theme two inter-related oppositions: continuity and change, moments and processes. In particular it examines the role these played in the development of varying settlement morphologies (the area under investigation contains both nucleated and dispersed settlement forms) and in the introduction and demise of the open field system.

Composite image from article showing screenshots of GIS and archive components

The article is based on the investigation of twenty-one medieval villages and hamlets and their surrounding landscapes, straddling the Northamptonshire-Buckinghamshire boundary and previously falling within the royal forest of Whittlewood. This work was undertaken between 2000 and 2005 as part of an AHRC (formerly ARHB)-funded research project. This enquiry, and the use it has made of the comparative method, has pinpointed moments of village and hamlet 'creation' and the alternative forms that these could take in their earliest phases. The subsequent development of these settlements has been charted, revealing the divergent paths they took towards the nucleated or dispersed plans they present when first mapped in the 17th, 18th or 19th centuries. This dynamic pattern of settlement has been set against a background of related changes to the authoritative landscape, which saw the fission and fusion of administrative units; to the economic landscape, which witnessed the development of the open field system and the re-organisation of woodland; and to social and cultural landscapes, affected inter alia by the growth and decline of population, and the imposition of Forest Law.

The reconstruction of these medieval village territories has only been achieved by adopting an interdisciplinary approach. Methodologies have included test pitting in village cores, larger excavations and trial trenches both within and outside the village, geophysical and earthwork survey, extensive fieldwalking, exhaustive documentary research, retrospective analysis of a rich corpus of early maps, targeted palaeoenvironmental sampling, detailed place-name study, and the comprehensive survey of the standing buildings of the area. This has generated a substantial body of evidence, the broader conclusions from which are due to be published in 2006 in a monograph entitled Medieval Villages in an English Landscape: Beginnings and Ends (Macclesfield, Windgather Press).

In embracing the unique opportunity offered by e-publishing and its integration with extensive digital archives, this article thus aims to achieve far more than simply duplicating its sister publication. It does not offer the in-depth explanations for change that are set out in the monograph, but rather focuses on the mechanics of change. But by presenting all the data on which reconstructions of these villages' territories have been based, readers will be able to test the veracity of the conclusions outlined both here and in the monograph, and to identify the intrinsic strengths and weaknesses of each class of evidence. It is hoped that by providing access to the data, readers will be encouraged to explore their own research agenda and to develop different readings of the evidence on which alternative models of medieval settlement and landscape change can be built.

  abstract = {High phonological neighborhood density has been associated with both advantages and disadvantages in early word learning. High density may support the formation and fine-tuning of new word sound memories\textemdash a process termed lexical configuration (e.g., Storkel, 2004). However, new high-density words are also more likely to be misunderstood as instances of known words, and may therefore fail to trigger the learning process (e.g., Swingley \& Aslin, 2007). To examine these apparently contradictory effects, we trained an autoencoder neural network on 587,954 word tokens (5,497 types, including mono- and multisyllabic words of all grammatical classes) spoken by 279 caregivers to English-speaking children aged 18\textendash 24 months. We then simulated a communicative development inventory administration and compared network performance to that of 2,292 children aged 18\textendash 24 months. We argue that autoencoder performance illustrates concurrent density advantages and disadvantages, in contrast to prior behavioral and computational literature treating such effects independently. Low network error rates signal a configuration advantage for high-density words, while high network error rates signal a triggering advantage for low-density words. This interpretation is consistent with the application of autoencoders in academic research and industry, for simultaneous feature extraction (i.e., configuration) and anomaly detection (i.e., triggering). Autoencoder simulation therefore illustrates how apparently contradictory density and distinctiveness effects can emerge from a common learning mechanism.

Over 100 studies have analyzed whether violent outcomes such as civil war, terrorism, and repression are more common in regimes that are neither full autocracies nor full democracies, yet findings are inconclusive. While this hypothesis is ultimately about functional form, existing work uses models in which a particular functional form is assumed. Existing work also uses arbitrary operationalizations of ``the middle.'' This article aims to resolve the empirical uncertainty about this relationship by using a research design that overcomes the limitations of existing work. We use a random forest-like ensemble of multivariate regression and classification trees to predict multiple forms of conflict. Our results indicate the specific conditions under which there is or is not more violence in the middle. We find the most consistent support for the hypothesis with respect to minor civil conflict and no support with respect to repression.},

If therapy quality and therapy outcome share a correlation of .20 (a somewhat optimistic assumption given the evidence we review), a therapy of perfect quality would produce an effect size of Hedges's g = 0.83.

Research suggests that, at peak fertility, women tend to prefer men with characteristics that reflect good genes for short-term sexual relationships. However, existing findings have been criticized for methodological flexibility and failing attempts to replicate core results. In a large (N=157), pre-registered, within-subject study spanning two ovulatory cycles, we investigated cycle shifts in women's mate preferences for masculine bodies. Using a large set of natural stimuli, we found that when fertile, women's ratings of male bodies increased for sexual as well as for long-term attractiveness. Both effects were partially mediated by the estradiol-to-progesterone-ratio. Furthermore, moderation analyses revealed that both shifts were only evident in women in relationships, but not in singles. Contrary to previous findings, male masculine traits did not interact with cycle phase to predict attraction, indicating that women's preferential priorities do not shift. Taken together, our results do not support women's mate preference shifts, as assumed by the good genes ovulatory shift hypothesis, but are consistent with shifting motivational priorities throughout the cycle. Implications of these results for female estrus theories and methodological recommendations for future research are discussed.},

The critical factor to utilize this paradigm is inducing a labile state of the long-term memory. Novel information is viewed as a driving factor to update memory; however, it is unknown whether different forms of novelty play the same role. In addition, although pharmacological intervention studies have confirmed that prediction error (PE) during reactivation is a necessary condition in memory destabilization, the role of PE in retrieval extinction has remained under debate; furthermore, the neural mechanisms underlying the process are largely unknown. In this study, we isolated two forms of novelty: PE and stimulus novelty without PE during reactivation to compare their role in memory lability. Skin conductance responses (SCR) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) were used to clarify their role at the behavioural and neural mechanism levels. A total of 54 healthy adults were tested in a three-day retrieval extinction protocol. The results showed that PE, the novelty of CS-US combinations, was a critical condition to destabilize memory. The novelty of the stimulus itself with the absence of PE was insufficient for retrieving the memory. The neural mechanisms that distinguished standard extinction from retrieval extinction were that the latter was associated with a diminished recruitment of the inferior temporal cortex (IT) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and decreased functional connectivity of the dlPFC-anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and IT-dlPFC. Possible interpretations were discussed.},

This article is the first to test how and when characteristics of active coalitions increase their lobbying success. Based on pluralist theory, one can expect diverse coalitions, uniting different societal interests, to signal broad support to policy makers. Yet, their responsiveness to this signal (i.e., signaling benefits) and contribution incentives within the coalition (i.e., cooperation costs) are likely to vary with issue salience. This theory is tested on a unique data set comprising 50 issues in five European countries. Results reveal a strong moderating effect of salience on the relationship between coalition diversity and success: On less salient issues, homogenous coalitions are more likely to succeed, whereas the effect reverses with higher salience, where diverse coalitions are more successful. These findings have implications for understanding political responsiveness and potential policy capture.},

  abstract = {Knowledge about biochemical processes is a prerequisite for a better understanding of mechanisms underlying brain activity. 1H functional magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-fMRS) at high magnetic fields allows for the non-invasive measurement of metabolic changes during brain activation. Optogenetics, on the other hand, has revolutionized the field of neuroscience. It was previously coupled with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) techniques in rodents enabling population-specific targeting of cells, investigating brain networks with unprecedented in vivo precision. The coupling of optogenetics and 1H-fMRS is expected to enhance the specificity of metabolic readouts to validate neuro-energetic theories underlying brain activity. To date, the feasibility of combining optogenetic stimulation with fMRS has not been explored. We used green laser stimulation delivered through an optical fiber implanted superficially above the primary somatosensory forelimb cortex (S1FL) of rats expressing the C1V1 opsin in excitatory neurons. A protocol for the acquisition of functional 1H MR spectra upon optogenetic stimulation without craniotomy-induced artefacts was established. Quantification of metabolite concentrations in S1FL upon optogenetic and electrical forepaw stimulation demonstrated significantly increased glutamate levels (+8.8\% and +9.9\%, p {$<$} 0.05 respectively), which were compensated by decreased glutamine levels (-17\% and -18\%, p {$<$} 0.05 respectively). Our results demonstrate for the first time the feasibility of combining optogenetic control and functional MR spectroscopy (o-fMRS) in the rat somatosensory cortex, opening new possibilities for monitoring the energetic demands of specific cell populations and for exploring the underpinnings of energy metabolism during brain activity.

Unexpectedly, we found few relationships between differentiation and the selection of putatively adaptive or maladaptive strategies. Instead, we found interactions between differentiation and strategies in predicting negative emotion. Among low differentiators, all strategies (Study 1) and four of six strategies (Study 2) were more strongly associated with increased negative emotion than they were among high differentiators. This suggests that low differentiation may hinder successful emotion regulation, which in turn supports the idea that effective regulation may underlie differentiation benefits.},

By observing the same participants (N = 139) in multiple dyadic interactions (618 data points) in a round-robin design, we disentangled the extent to which mimicry is due to (a) the mimicker's general tendency to mimic (imitativity), (b) the mimickee's general tendency to evoke mimicry (imitatability), and (c) the unique dyadic relationship between the mimicker and the mimickee. We explored how these mimicry components affected liking and metaperceptions of liking (i.e., metaliking). Employing social relations models, we found substantial interindividual differences in imitativity, which predicted popularity. However, we found only small interindividual differences in imitatability. We found support for our proposition that mimicry is a substantially dyadic construct explained mostly by the unique relationship between two people. Finally, we explored the link between dyadic mimicry and liking, and we found that a person's initial liking of his or her interaction partner led to mimicry, which in turn increased the partner's liking of the mimicker.},

  abstract = {Abstract The AMPA-type glutamate receptor (AMPA-R) plays a primary role in principal excitatory synaptic transmission and many neuronal functions including synaptic plasticity that underlie learning and memory. N-glycosylation is one of the major post-translational modifications of membrane proteins, but its specific roles in neurons remain largely unknown. AMPA-R subunits are N-glycosylated at their extracellular domains during their biosynthesis in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi system. Six N-glycosylation sites are presumed to exist in the extracellular domain of GluA1, which is a member of the AMPA-R subunits. We observed that the intracellular trafficking and cell surface expression were strongly suppressed in the GluA1 mutants lacking N-glycans at N63/N363 in HEK293T cells. Multimer analysis using Blue Native-PAGE displayed the impaired tetramer formation in the glycosylation mutants (N63S and N363S), indicating that the mis-transport was caused by impaired tetramer formation. N63S and N363S mutants were primarily degraded via the lysosomal pathway. Flag-tagged N363S GluA1, but not N63S GluA1, expressed in primary cortical neuron cultures prepared from GluA1 knockout mice was observed to localize at the cell surface. Co-expression of GluA2 partially rescued tetramer formation and the cell surface expression of N363S GluA1 but not N63S GluA1, in HEK293T cells. Electrophysiological analysis also demonstrated functional heteromers of N363S GluA1 with GluA2. These data suggest that site-specific N-glycans on GluA1 subunit regulates tetramer formation, intracellular trafficking, and cell surface expression of AMPA-R.

This research shows that individual differences in self?compassion, as measured by the Self?Compassion Scale (SCS), are positively related to life satisfaction, health and social functioning. However, a critical and systematic test of self?compassion from a personality perspective has not yet conducted so far. In the present study (N~=~576), we (i) tested the factor structure of the SCS, (ii) examined the distinctiveness of self?compassion with regard to the five?factor model of personality, focusing on neuroticism, and (iii) tested the incremental predictive power of self?compassion beyond the five?factor model in the context of life satisfaction. Confirmatory factor analyses supported a two?factor plus six facets solution of self?compassion (a positive factor and a negative factor). Additional analyses revealed that the negative factor was redundant with facets of neuroticism (rs~{$\geq~$}.85), whereas the positive factor had some unique variance left. However, neither the negative factor nor the positive factor could explain substantial incremental variance in life satisfaction beyond neuroticism. Recommendations for how to use the SCS are provided, and the future of research on self?compassion is discussed. Copyright ? 2017 European Association of Personality Psychology},

  abstract = {In two studies, we examined the genetic and environmental sources of the unfolding of personality trait differences from childhood to emerging adulthood. Using self-reports from over 3000 representative German twin pairs of three birth cohorts, we could replicate previous findings on the primary role of genetic sources accounting for the unfolding of inter-individual differences in personality traits and stabilizing trait differences during adolescence. More specifically, the genetic variance increased between early (ages 10\textendash 12 years) and late (ages 16\textendash 18 years) adolescence and stabilized between late adolescence and young adulthood (ages 21\textendash 25 years). This trend could be confirmed in a second three-wave longitudinal study of adolescents' personality self-reports and parent ratings from about 1400 Norwegian twin families (average ages between 15 and 20 years). Moreover, the longitudinal study provided evidence for increasing genetic differences being primarily due to accumulation of novel genetic influences instead of an amplification of initial genetic variation. This is in line with cumulative interaction effects between twins' correlated genetic makeups and environmental circumstances shared by adolescent twins reared together. In other words, nature \texttimes{} nurture interactions rather than transactions can account for increases in genetic variance and thus personality variance during adolescence. \textcopyright{} 2019 European Association of Personality Psychology},

  abstract = {Undergraduates (N = 274) participated in a weeklong daily-life experience-sampling study of mind wandering after being assessed in the lab for executive-control abilities (working memory capacity; attention-restraint ability; attention-constraint ability; and propensity for task-unrelated thoughts, or TUTs) and personality traits. Eight times a day, electronic devices prompted subjects to report on their current thoughts and context. Working memory capacity and attention abilities predicted subjects' TUT rates in the lab, but predicted the frequency of daily-life mind wandering only as a function of subjects' momentary attempts to concentrate. This pattern replicates prior daily-life findings but conflicts with laboratory findings. Results for personality factors also revealed different associations in the lab and daily life: Only neuroticism predicted TUT rate in the lab, but only openness predicted mind-wandering rate in daily life (both predicted the content of daily-life mind wandering). Cognitive and personality factors also predicted dimensions of everyday thought other than mind wandering, such as subjective judgments of controllability of thought. Mind wandering in people's daily environments and TUTs during controlled and artificial laboratory tasks have different correlates (and perhaps causes). Thus, mind-wandering theories based solely on lab phenomena may be incomplete.},

This lack of usage may stem from fears of distorting treatment effects and uncertainty regarding which type to use (e.g., instructional manipulation checks [IMCs] or assessments of whether stimuli alter a latent independent variable of interest). Here, we first categorize the main variants and argue that factual manipulation checks (FMCs)\textemdash that is, objective questions about key elements of the experiment\textemdash can identify individual-level attentiveness to experimental information and, as a consequence, better enable researchers to diagnose experimental findings. We then find, through four replication studies, little evidence that FMC placement affects treatment effects, and that placing FMCs immediately post-outcome does not attenuate FMC passage rates. Additionally, FMC and IMC passage rates are only weakly related, suggesting that each technique identifies different sets of attentive subjects. Thus, unlike other methods, FMCs can confirm attentiveness to experimental protocols.},

The objective was to determine which approach to measuring intelligibility would be most reliable for predicting listener comprehension, as measured through a listening comprehension test similar to the Test of English as a Foreign Language. The speakers included 18 English users representing six distinct varieties. These speakers? speech was evaluated by 60 listeners, users of the same English varieties who completed the listening comprehension test as well as five intelligibility tasks, all recorded by the speakers. The five measures of intelligibility included responses to true/false statements, scalar ratings of speech, perception of nonsense sentences, perception of filtered sentences, and transcription of speech; these measures were compared in terms of their relationship to listening comprehension scores using linear mixed?effects models. Results showed that the measure of intelligibility based on listeners? responses to nonsense sentences was the strongest predictor of the listening comprehension scores.},

The study includes 120 English-speaking learners of Spanish from 5 course levels and 20 native speakers (NSs) of Spanish. Participants completed an oral production task, in which they responded to 8 personal prompts. Results indicate that NSs used lexical futures robustly and that part of the development associated with the acquisition of future-time expression included increases in the overall rates of lexical future use and the inventory of lexical future periphrases. Mixed-effects models revealed that from the earliest level lexical futures could be differentiated from the PI as predicted by independent variables, and that independent variables patterned in a more target-like way as course level increased.},

Here, we demonstrated the phenomenon of vicarious optimism and showed that it arises from concern for others. Participants predicted the likelihood of unpleasant future events that could happen to either themselves or others. In addition to showing an optimistic learning bias for events affecting themselves, people showed vicarious optimism when learning about events affecting friends and strangers. Vicarious optimism for strangers correlated with generosity toward strangers, and experimentally increasing concern for strangers amplified vicarious optimism for them. These findings suggest that concern for others can bias beliefs about their future welfare and that optimism in learning is not restricted to oneself.},

L1 performance of Turkish immigrants (n = 57) in the United Kingdom with age at onset ranging between 7 and 34 years was compared to that of Turkish monolingual controls (n = 29) across two linguistic properties: structural complexity and accent. Findings generally showed that although the immigrants achieved nativelike proficiency with respect to the overall structural complexity of their L1, this was not the case for accent as those with an earlier age of onset were less likely to sound like native Turkish speakers. We discuss these findings in relation to two competing theoretical models of age effects and suggest that attrition data need to be better accommodated within these models.

  abstract = {Past research suggests that pathogen-avoidance motives (e.g., disgust sensitivity) relate to greater opposition to immigration. Two accounts have been proposed to explain this relationship, one of which emphasizes proximally avoiding outgroups, and the other of which emphasizes adherence to traditional norms. According to the former, immigrants are perceived as being more infectious because they carry novel pathogens due to their foreign ecological origins. According to the latter, immigrants' foreign norms are perceived as posing a pathogen threat. This study aimed to disentangle these accounts. Participants (N = 975) were randomly assigned to read a description of an immigrant who had high or low contact with locals and high or low assimilation to local norms. The effect of disgust sensitivity on sentiments toward the immigrant (and immigrants like him) was compared across conditions. Results supported the traditional norms account: disgust sensitivity related to anti-immigrant sentiments when the immigrant was described as not assimilating to local norms, but not when he was described as assimilating. Contrary to the outgroup avoidance account, the relationship between disgust sensitivity and anti-immigrant sentiments did not vary across the high-contact and low-contact conditions. Results suggest that resistance to foreign norms, rather than avoidance of novel pathogens, better explains the relationship between pathogen avoidance and outgroup prejudice.},

For second language (L2) grammar learning, some studies reveal advantages for spacing of 7 days or more, but others for shorter spacing. Further, little is known about the role of cognitive individual differences (e.g., language analytic ability; LAA) in mediating practice distribution effects for L2 grammatical knowledge development and retention. To address this gap, this classroom-based study investigated whether distribution of practice and LAA moderated the effectiveness of explicit, input-based grammar instruction for young first language (L1) English learners of French (aged 8 to 11). The study revealed minimal differences between longer (7-day) versus shorter (3.5-day) spacing of practice for learning a French verb inflection subsystem, at either posttest or delayed posttest. Minimal group-level gains and substantial within-group variation in performance at posttests were observed. Accuracy of practice during training and LAA were significantly associated with posttest performance under both practice schedules. These findings indicated that within an ecologically valid classroom context, differences in distribution of practice had limited impact on learner performance on our tests; rather, individual learner differences were more critical in moderating learning. This highlights the importance of considering individual learner differences in the development of resources and the potential of digital tools for dynamically adapting instruction to suit individuals.},

In a large longitudinal cohort of adolescents and young adults (N = 785; n = 566 across two waves, mean interval between waves = 1.48 years; age range = 14\textendash 25 years), we examined developmental changes in two core cognitive domains, fluid reasoning and vocabulary. We used bivariate latent change score models to compare three leading accounts of cognitive development: g-factor theory, investment theory, and mutualism. We showed that a mutualism model, which proposes that basic cognitive abilities directly and positively interact during development, provides the best account of developmental changes. We found that individuals with higher scores in vocabulary showed greater gains in matrix reasoning and vice versa. These dynamic coupling pathways are not predicted by other accounts and provide a novel mechanistic window into cognitive development.},

Third, we found support for the hypothesis that mutualistic-coupling effects are stronger and self-feedback parameters weaker in younger children.

  abstract = {The organisation of pitch-perception mechanisms in the primate cortex is controversial, in that divergent results have been obtained, ranging from a single circumscribed `pitch centre' to systems widely distributed across auditory cortex. Possible reasons for such discrepancies include different species, recording techniques, pitch stimuli, sampling of auditory fields, and the neural metrics recorded. In the present study, we sought to bridge some of these divisions by examining activity related to pitch in both neurons and neuronal ensembles within the auditory cortex of the rhesus macaque, a primate species with similar pitch perception and auditory cortical organisation to humans. We demonstrate similar responses, in primary and non-primary auditory cortex, to two different types of broadband pitch above the macaque lower limit in both neurons and local field potential (LFP) gamma oscillations. The majority of broadband pitch responses in neurons and LFP sites did not show equivalent tuning for sine tones.},

  abstract = {Abstract Mlc1 is a causative gene for megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts, and is expressed in astrocytes. Mlc1-over-expressing mice represent an animal model of early-onset leukoencephalopathy, which manifests as astrocytic swelling followed by myelin membrane splitting in the white matter. It has been previously reported that Mlc1 is highly expressed in Bergmann glia, while the cerebellar phenotypes of Mlc1-over-expressing mouse have not been characterized. Here, we examined the cerebellum of Mlc1-over-expressing mouse and found that the distribution of Bergmann glia (BG) was normally compacted along the Purkinje cell (PC) layer until postnatal day 10 (P10), while most BG were dispersed throughout the molecular layer by P28. Ectopic BG were poorly wrapped around somatodendritic elements of PCs and exhibited reduced expression of the glutamate transporter glutamate-aspartate transporter. Extraordinarily slow and small climbing fiber (CF)-mediated excitatory post-synaptic currents, which are known to be elicited under accelerated glutamate spillover, emerged at P20-P28 when BG ectopia was severe, but not at P9-P12 when ectopia was mild. Furthermore, maturation of CF wiring, which translocates the site of innervation from somata to proximal dendrites, was also impaired. Manipulations that restricted the Mlc1-over-expressing period successfully generated mice with and without BG ectopia, depending on the over-expressing period. Together, these findings suggest that there is a critical time window for mechanisms that promote the positioning of BG in the PC layer. Once normal positioning of BG is affected, the differentiation of BG is impaired, leading to insufficient glial wrapping, exacerbated glutamate spillover, and aberrant synaptic wiring in PCs.

In this article, I propose that the presence of direct democracy expands gender equality in political participation by signaling the system's openness to women's voice, confirming their political competency, and highlighting their stake in political decisions. To test this argument, I leverage a quasi-experiment in Sweden in the aftermath of the introduction of universal suffrage, where the type of municipal political institutions was determined by a population threshold. My findings lend strong support to the effect of direct democracy on the political inclusion of women. I find that the gender gap in electoral participation was smaller in municipalities using direct democracy than in similarly sized municipalities that only had representative institutions.},

In contrast, the current research suggests that anthropomorphic helpers are not universally conducive to help-seeking behavior in contexts of achievement, particularly among individuals who construe help seeking as a display of incompetence (i.e., entity theorists). Study 1 demonstrated that when entity theorists received help from an anthropomorphized (vs. a nonanthropomorphized) helper, they were more concerned about negative judgments from other people, whereas incremental theorists were not affected by anthropomorphic features. Study 2 showed that when help was provided by an anthropomorphized (vs. a nonanthropomorphized) helper, entity theorists were less likely to seek help, even at the cost of lower performance. In contrast, incremental theorists' help-seeking behavior and task performance were not affected by anthropomorphism. This research deepens the current understanding of the role of anthropomorphic computerized helpers in online learning contexts.},

The present study, informed by the pathogen-prevalence hypothesis, tested the influence of individualism and collectivism on xenophobic response to the threat of Ebola. A nationally representative sample of 1,000 Americans completed a survey, indicating their perceptions of their vulnerability to Ebola, ability to protect themselves from Ebola (protection efficacy), and xenophobic tendencies. Overall, the more vulnerable people felt, the more they exhibited xenophobic responses, but this relationship was moderated by individualism and collectivism. The increase in xenophobia associated with increased vulnerability was especially pronounced among people with high individualism scores and those with low collectivism scores. These relationships were mediated by protection efficacy. State-level collectivism had the same moderating effect on the association between perceived vulnerability and xenophobia that individual-level value orientation did. Collectivism\textemdash and the set of practices and rituals associated with collectivistic cultures\textemdash may serve as psychological protection against the threat of disease.},

The proposed method classifies a set of dyads into several clusters based on their similarities in trade profile\textemdash the product composition of imports and exports\textemdash and captures the evolution of the resulting clusters over time. We apply this method to two billion observations of product-level annual trade flows.

Finally, we illustrate the critical roles of our trade profile measure in international relations research on trade competition.},

Inconsistent with a general self-enhancement effect, results showed that self-report means generally did not differ from informant-report means (average {$\delta$} = -.038). Moderate mean differences were found only when we compared self-reports with stranger reports, suggesting that people are critical of unacquainted targets. We discuss implications of these findings for personality assessment and other fields in which self-enhancement motives are relevant.},

To this end, we isolated the effects of the physical medium of input (i.e., aural or visual) from those of the presentation method (i.e., word-by-word or simultaneous). We also explored the role of test modality in L2 performance, by including L2 knowledge tests in both aural and visual modes. Native English speakers engaged in meaning-focused integrated practice of 3 German syntactic rules. In Experiment 1, learners were given aural or visual word-by-word (rapid serial visual presentation; RSVP) input and in Experiment 2, they were given aural or natural written input. We found evidence of learning across all 4 groups, but different types of resultant knowledge. In particular, learners gained explicit knowledge in all input modalities, yet only those trained with natural written input also developed robust implicit knowledge. We conclude that the permanence of visual input may be a critical advantage for beginning learners to develop implicit knowledge of word order rules. Support in the form of written materials can ease the cognitive burden on beginning learners, with better outcomes as a result.},

Although it is hypothesized that urgency is characterized by reflexive responses to negative emotion that focus on immediate relief from distress, little research has addressed this hypothesis. Using data from four independent samples of adolescents and college students (n = 1,268), we estimated the association between trait negative urgency and emotion regulation strategies that reflect either reflexive responses or disengagement. We verified these effects in two ecological momentary assessment samples (EMA; n = 198). In retrospective data, negative urgency was correlated with using more disengagement or reflexive emotion regulation strategies relative to engagement strategies, r = .39, .38, 95\% confidence interval (CI) = [0.30, 0.49], [0.18, 0.57]. This finding replicated in EMA data, r = .24, 95\% CI = [0.11, 0.38]. Emotion regulation may be a key mechanism of the effects of urgency on psychopathology. Interventions targeting emotion regulation among those high on urgency may be warranted.},

I support my hypotheses with a nationally representative survey of 3,000 adult women and two survey experiments, each with over 1,000 adult women.

Specifically, we showed that creating conflict between a spatial location and a metaphorically linked concept reduces perceived differences between the attitudes of partisans who are generally viewed as possessing fundamentally different worldviews (Democrats and Republicans). We further demonstrated that metaphorical conflict reduces perceived attitude differences by creating a mind-set in which categories are represented as possessing broader boundaries than when concepts are metaphorically compatible. These results suggest that metaphorical conflict shapes social perception by making members of distinct groups appear more similar than they are generally thought to be. These findings have important implications for research on conflict, embodied cognition, and social perception.},

  abstract = {We conducted preregistered replications of 28 classic and contemporary published findings, with protocols that were peer reviewed in advance, to examine variation in effect magnitudes across samples and settings. Each protocol was administered to approximately half of 125 samples that comprised 15,305 participants from 36 countries and territories. Using the conventional criterion of statistical significance (p {$<$} .05), we found that 15 (54\%) of the replications provided evidence of a statistically significant effect in the same direction as the original finding. With a strict significance criterion (p {$<$} .0001), 14 (50\%) of the replications still provided such evidence, a reflection of the extremely high-powered design. Seven (25\%) of the replications yielded effect sizes larger than the original ones, and 21 (75\%) yielded effect sizes smaller than the original ones. The median comparable Cohen's ds were 0.60 for the original findings and 0.15 for the replications. The effect sizes were small ({$<$} 0.20) in 16 of the replications (57\%), and 9 effects (32\%) were in the direction opposite the direction of the original effect. Across settings, the Q statistic indicated significant heterogeneity in 11 (39\%) of the replication effects, and most of those were among the findings with the largest overall effect sizes; only 1 effect that was near zero in the aggregate showed significant heterogeneity according to this measure. Only 1 effect had a tau value greater than .20, an indication of moderate heterogeneity. Eight others had tau values near or slightly above .10, an indication of slight heterogeneity. Moderation tests indicated that very little heterogeneity was attributable to the order in which the tasks were performed or whether the tasks were administered in lab versus online. Exploratory comparisons revealed little heterogeneity between Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic (WEIRD) cultures and less WEIRD cultures (i.e., cultures with relatively high and low WEIRDness scores, respectively). Cumulatively, variability in the observed effect sizes was attributable more to the effect being studied than to the sample or setting in which it was studied.},

Using a modified concealed-information test (CIT), we aimed to unmask this process by investigating both the decision and the attempt to conceal information in 38 students. The attempt to conceal (vs. reveal) information induced a differential physiological response pattern within subjects\textemdash whereas skin conductance increased in both conditions, respiration and heart rate were suppressed only in the conceal condition\textemdash confirming the idea that these measures reflect different underlying mechanisms. The decision to conceal (vs. reveal) information induced enhanced anticipatory skin conductance responses. To our knowledge, this is the first study that observed such anticipatory responses in an information-concealment paradigm. Together, these findings imply that our physiological responses reflect, to some degree, both the decision and the attempt to conceal information. In addition to strengthening CIT theory, this knowledge sheds novel light on anticipatory responding in decision making.},

Three studies provide support for our interpretation of the Napoleon complex. Our pilot study shows that men (but not women) keep more resources for themselves when they feel small. When paired with a taller male opponent (Study 1), shorter men keep more resources to themselves in a game in which they have all the power (dictator game) versus a game in which the opponent also has some power (ultimatum game). Furthermore, shorter men are not more likely to show direct, physical aggression toward a taller opponent (Study 2). As predicted by the Napoleon complex, we conclude that (relatively) shorter men show greater behavioral flexibility in securing resources when presented with cues that they are physically less competitive. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.},

By using objective measurements of speakers' acoustic cues and controlling for baseline cue levels, we were able to precisely capture the relationship between acoustic cues and hierarchical rank, as well as the covariation among the cues. In Experiment 1, analyses controlling for speakers' baseline cue levels found that the voices of individuals in the high-rank condition were higher in pitch and loudness variability but lower in pitch variability, compared with the voices of individuals in the low-rank condition. In Experiment 2, perceivers used higher pitch, greater loudness, and greater loudness variability to make accurate inferences of speakers' hierarchical rank. These experiments demonstrate that acoustic cues are systematically used to reflect and detect hierarchy.},

While having widespread theoretical and intuitive appeal, this notion has barely been tested empirically. We used a recently developed paradigm to test whether severely corrupt acts happen gradually or abruptly. The results of four experimental studies revealed a higher likelihood of severe corruption when participants were directly given the opportunity to engage in it (abrupt) compared with when they had previously engaged in minor forms of corruption (gradual). Neither the size of the payoffs, which we kept constant, nor evaluations of the actions could account for these differences. Contrary to widely shared beliefs, sometimes the route to corruption leads over a steep cliff rather than a slippery slope.},

The analysis confirms that timing influences voter composition in terms of partisanship, ideology, and the numerical strength of powerful interest groups. But, in contrast to prominent theories of election timing, these effects are modest in terms of their likely impact on election outcomes. Instead, timing has the most significant impact on voter age, with the elderly being the most overrepresented group in low-turnout special elections. The electoral (and policy) implications of this effect vary between states, and we offer one explanation for this variation.},

Detailing exactly what this restriction requires divides right and left libertarians. Briefly, right libertarians interpret ``enough and as good'' as requiring no or very minimal restrictions on the first appropriation of natural resources, whereas left libertarians interpret ``enough and as good'' as requiring everyone to be entitled to an equal share of unappropriated resources, able to claim no more beyond this equal share. This article approaches the right versus left libertarian debate by developing a formal model that examines the welfare properties of different interpretations of the Lockean proviso. The model shows that underlying philosophical justifications for left libertarianism, when plausible assumptions hold, will actually be better served by a right libertarian proviso rather than a left libertarian one.},

Grounded in social schema research, we hypothesize that a future-orientation is a means to broaden thinking through activating change and progress schemas, which in turn facilitates creativity. We first offered qualitative evidence that people generally hold a schema that the future is inundated with change and progress. In three experimental studies, we established the creative benefit of future-oriented (vs. present-oriented) thinking in divergent thinking tasks. Further, we offered support that schemas of change and progress mediate the link between future-oriented (vs. present-oriented) thinking and creativity (Study 2) and demonstrated the causal role of schema activation by manipulating accessibility of change and progress schemas under a future-orientation (Study 3). We discuss the implications of how the study of schematic future projections contributes to creative cognition.},

Using performance-based tasks, we show that triggering events, in which B moves noticeably faster than A, are treated as being categorically different from launching events, in which B does not move noticeably faster than A, and that these categories are unique to causal events (Experiments 1 and 2). Furthermore, we show that 7- to 9-month-old infants are sensitive to this distinction, which suggests that this boundary may be an early-developing component of causal perception (Experiment 3).},

The results showed that for those who reported losses of an experience or cherished material object, perpetrators' offers of compensation did not facilitate forgiveness. In Study 2, by manipulating replaceability of hypothetical losses in vignettes, we showed that compensation for replaceable losses effectively elicits forgiveness from a victim, but compensation for irreplaceable losses is ineffective. A series of mediation analyses showed that the effect of replaceability on forgiveness is explained by the victim's perception of whether their loss was sufficiently recovered.

In addition to nine previously conducted and reported studies (focussing only on embarrassment, Kommattam, Jonas, \& Fischer, 2017, Studies 1\textendash 9), we conducted a series of three additional studies including white Dutch, U.S., and U.K. participants (N total = 3201) judging the intensity of nine different emotions displayed by different ethnic group members.

We reasoned that students' understanding of science concepts such as torque and angular momentum is aided by activation of sensorimotor brain systems that add kinetic detail and meaning to students' thinking. We tested whether physical experience with angular momentum increases involvement of sensorimotor brain systems during students' subsequent reasoning and whether this involvement aids their understanding. The physical experience, a brief exposure to forces associated with angular momentum, significantly improved quiz scores. Moreover, improved performance was explained by activation of sensorimotor brain regions when students later reasoned about angular momentum. This finding specifies a mechanism underlying the value of physical experience in science education and leads the way for classroom practices in which experience with the physical world is an integral part of learning.},

Modern reinforcement-learning theories formalize this distinction as a competition between a computationally cheap but inaccurate model-free system that gives rise to habits and a computationally expensive but accurate model-based system that implements planning. It is unclear, however, how people choose to allocate control between these systems. Here, we propose that arbitration occurs by comparing each system's task-specific costs and benefits. To investigate this proposal, we conducted two experiments showing that people increase model-based control when it achieves greater accuracy than model-free control, and especially when the rewards of accurate performance are amplified. In contrast, they are insensitive to reward amplification when model-based and model-free control yield equivalent accuracy. This suggests that humans adaptively balance habitual and planned action through on-line cost-benefit analysis.},

Although evaluative priming is widely used as an implicit measure of evaluation, there is no common procedure for the treatment of response-latency outliers. To address this limitation, four studies examined common outlier-treatments in terms of (1) the overall size of evaluative priming effects, (2) their internal consistency, and (3) their relation to corresponding explicit measures in the domains of conditioned attitudes (Study 1), political attitudes (Study 2), racial attitudes (Study 3), and ethnic attitudes (Study 4). The algorithm with the best performance uses a priori cutoffs of 300 ms and 1000 ms, treating response times beyond these cutoffs as missing values. Internal consistency was low for all algorithms, indicating limits in the usefulness of evaluative priming for correlational studies.},

Objective measures and subjective ratings of male sexually dimorphic traits purportedly under sexual selection (height, vocal and facial masculinity, upper body size from 3D scans, physical strength, and baseline testosterone) and observer perceptions of physical dominance and sexual attractiveness based on self-presentation video recordings were assessed and associated with mating success (sociosexual behaviour and number of potential conceptions) in a partly longitudinal design. Results from structural equation models and selection analyses revealed that physical dominance, but not sexual attractiveness, predicted mating success. Physical dominance mediated associations of upper body size, physical strength, as well as vocal and facial physical dominance and attractiveness with mating success.

  abstract = {Abstract Personality development is characterized by increasing maturation, that is, people become more conscientious, agreeable and emotionally stable as they age. In late life, however, these trends seem to be reversed. Because many changes and transitions in older age are related to health, we investigated correlated changes in health problems and personality traits, the sources of health changes in later life and the directionality of effects. Our sample consisted of older adult twins, aged 64?85~years at time 1 (n~=~410; 135 male/275 female; 134 monozygotic/63 dizygotic twin pairs), assessed at two different time points about five years apart, and we ran bivariate latent change and latent change twin model analyses. Increasing health problems were associated with decreases in agreeableness, extraversion, emotional stability and conscientiousness. Changes in health problems were only due to environmental influences, implying that the association between health and personality changes was exclusively environmental. Directional effects were largely absent, but health and personality were significantly related at the second measurement occasion (age 69?89~years). Our results support the link between health change and personality change in late life and spark the assumption of normative personality adaptations to deterioration of health status as a means of developmental regulation.

However, these dilemmas are usually unrealistic thought experiments, with implausibly few options and implausible statements about the consequences of these options. The present research examines whether variations in dilemma plausibility influence moral judgments. This influence might result from two psychological factors\textemdash cost\textendash benefit calculations and reactance-type processes. Both can be predicted to cause more deontological judgments for implausible compared to plausible moral dilemmas. In two experiments (total N = 417), dilemmas were modified to create a plausible and an implausible version without altering the actions and their alleged consequences. We observed that low (compared to high) plausibility within dilemmas increased deontological judgments. Consequently, varying plausibility constitutes a potential confound when examining moral cognition by comparing different dilemma versions. We suggest using only plausible dilemmas to examine moral judgments.},

The proposed mechanism is often labeled as the ``room to maneuver,'' and it posits that because elected officials have limited space to propose and implement economic policy, politicians can shirk responsibility, and thus voters are less likely to place voting weights on the economy. However, results from elections that took place in Europe during the Great Recession and scholarly research on economic voting in these elections cast serious doubts on the causal mechanism. This article directly tests this mechanism with a survey experiment using data from Greece (the country most affected by the debt crisis). The results suggest that although the economic vote is strong and substantive, its size does not vary across the room to maneuver treatments. This finding informs the literature on economic voting and carries out important implications for party strategies with respect to exogenous policy impositions and their electoral effects.},

We found that visually entrained theta oscillations sharply increased for unexpected outcomes, in contrast to expected outcomes, in the scalp-recorded electroencephalogram. Visually entrained alpha oscillations did not differ between conditions. The processing of unexpected events at the theta rhythm may reflect learning processes such as the refinement of infants' basic representations. Visual brain-stimulation techniques provide new ways to investigate the functional relevance of neuronal oscillatory dynamics in early brain development.},

In a laboratory analogue, the third-party-punishment game, third parties (``punishers'') will often spend real money to anonymously punish bad behavior directed at other people. A common explanation is that third-party punishment exists to maintain a cooperative society. We tested a different explanation: Third-party punishment results from a deterrence psychology for defending personal interests. Because humans evolved in small-scale, face-to-face social worlds, the mind infers that mistreatment of a third party predicts later mistreatment of oneself. We showed that when punishers do not have information about how they personally will be treated, they infer that mistreatment of other people predicts mistreatment of themselves, and these inferences predict punishment. But when information about personal mistreatment is available, it drives punishment. This suggests that humans' punitive psychology evolved to defend personal interests.},

  abstract = {In recent years, several oppressive leaders have been arrested and extradited to international courts. What are the consequences of this global justice cascade? I address this question by examining patterns of exile. I show that the justice cascade has a differential effect on leaders based on their culpability (whether they presided over atrocity crimes). In the past, culpable and nonculpable leaders went into exile at virtually identical rates. Today, however, culpable leaders are about six times less likely to flee abroad because exile no longer guarantees a safe retirement. These findings raise stark implications for existing research that debates whether international justice deters atrocities or prolongs conflicts. My results about exiled leaders, I explain, imply that the justice cascade should deter atrocities and prolong conflicts. Thus, instead of debating whether international justice is helpful or harmful, future scholarship should carefully consider the trade-offs it creates.},

  abstract = {Reactions to other people who get desirable outcomes should be a simple function of how much one desires those outcomes. Four studies (N = 4,978) suggest that one's reactions depend on the temporal location of outcome acquisition: Observers care more (e.g., feel more envy) right before, versus right after, other people have identical experiences (Studies 1, 2a, and 2b). For example, participants' envy in February rose as Valentine's Day approached (as a peer's enviable date loomed in the future) but abruptly plateaued come February 15 onward (after the date occurred). Further, the passing of time specifically assuaged the pain of comparison (whereas positive reactions, such as feeling inspired, remained high; Studies 3a, 3b, and 3c); therefore, taking a past perspective can be used to regulate negative emotions in the present (Study 4). Time asymmetrically shapes the experience of upward comparison, despite other people's desirable outcomes indeed being achieved. Other people's good lives sting less if they have already lived them.},

To test the relevance of personality for core aspects of sleep, we examined if personality traits across the five broad personality domains predicted behaviourally recorded, week-long sleep characteristics up to five years later (alongside subjective sleep quality). Data from 382 participants (63\% female, aged 34\textendash 82 years) were drawn from the longitudinal study on Midlife in the United States Study\textemdash Biomarker project. In terms of mean tendencies, both neuroticism and conscientiousness signalled more sleep continuity (fewer interruptions) alongside better subjective quality. In terms of intra-individual sleep variability, neuroticism predicted more variability in sleep duration, continuity, and subjective sleep quality, while conscientiousness predicted less variability in sleep duration and sleep continuity. Extraversion, agreeableness, and openness traits did not generally foreshadow behaviourally recoded sleep, only higher ratings of subjective quality. These links were robust to the impact of demographic factors and were not moderated by the duration of time between personality and sleep assessments. The findings distinguish which personality traits foreshadow core aspects of sleep and also implicate multiple traits as predictors of variability, not just mean tendencies, in behaviourally recorded sleep. \textcopyright{} 2019 European Association of Personality Psychology},

The moderated effects had strong evidential value across all three studies (as indicated by a p-curve analysis), yet the main effects were significant only in Studies 1 and 3. These findings underline the importance of adding personality and situational factors when examining the impact of bodily positions that activate approach and avoidance on motivated behavior such as food choice.},

We built a mathematical model of the evolution of conflict under inequality and tested its predictions in an experimental game with 1,205 participants. We found that inequality increases conflict, destroys wealth, and engenders risk taking. Crucially, these effects are amplified by local competition. Thus, inequality is at its most damaging when it arises between close competitors. Indeed, at the extremes, the combined effects of inequality and the scale of competition are very large. More broadly, our findings suggest that disagreements in the literature may be the result of a mismatch between the scale at which inequality is measured and the scale at which conflict occurs.},

The current study utilized the social accuracy model to investigate the effects of differences in thin slices of information quantity on the distinctive accuracy and normativity of personality trait judgments. It was hypothesized that distinctive accuracy and normativity would increase as information quantity increased. Participants were 431 individuals who participated in an online study that varied the length of stimulus target observations (30 seconds, 1 minute, 3 minutes, and 5 minutes), after which judges rated targets using other-report measures of the Big Five personality traits. For all traits combined, significant levels of accuracy were found for all observation lengths, but distinctive accuracy and normativity did not increase as video length increased. Findings varied for individual traits. For distinctive accuracy, there was a linear increase with information quantity for Extraversion and a non-linear relationship for Conscientiousness, while there was a linear decrease for Openness. For normativity, there was a linear increase with information quantity for Agreeableness and a non-linear relationship for Conscientiousness. There are important differences in how observation length affects distinctive accuracy and normativity for different personality traits. \textcopyright{} 2019 European Association of Personality Psychology},

While this process has been well-established for basic (e.g., grasping) and complex (e.g., dancing) actions, it remains unknown if the framework of action simulation is applicable to visual languages such as American Sign Language (ASL). We conducted an EEG experiment with deaf signers and hearing non-signers to compare overall sensorimotor EEG between groups, and to test whether sensorimotor systems are differentially sensitive to signs that are produced with one hand (``1H'') or two hands (``2H''). We predicted greater alpha and beta event-related desynchronization (previously correlated with action simulation) during the perception of 2H ASL signs compared to 1H ASL signs, due to greater demands on sensorimotor processing systems required for producing two-handed actions. We recorded EEG from both groups as they observed videos of ASL signs, half 1H and half 2H. Event-related spectral perturbations (ERSPs) in the alpha and beta ranges were computed for the two conditions at central electrode sites overlying the sensorimotor cortex. Sensorimotor EEG responses in both Hearing and Deaf groups were sensitive to the observed gross motor characteristics of the observed signs. We show for the first time that despite hearing non-signers showing overall more sensorimotor cortex involvement during sign observation, mirroring-related processes are in fact involved when deaf signers observe signs.},

This article reports a preregistered large-scale attempt to replicate four influential anticipatory-looking implicit theory-of-mind tasks using original stimuli and procedures. Results showed that only one of the four paradigms was reliably replicated. A second set of studies revealed, further, that this one paradigm was no longer replicated once confounds were removed, which calls its validity into question. There were also no correlations between paradigms, and thus, no evidence for their convergent validity. In conclusion, findings from anticipatory-looking false-belief paradigms seem less reliable and valid than previously assumed, thus limiting the conclusions that can be drawn from them.},

Although most research comparing these two types                     of purchases has focused on their downstream hedonic consequences, the present                     research investigated hedonic differences that occur before                     consumption. We argue that waiting for experiences tends to be more positive                     than waiting for possessions. Four studies demonstrate that people derive more                     happiness from the anticipation of experiential purchases and that waiting for                     an experience tends to be more pleasurable and exciting than waiting to receive                     a material good. We found these effects in studies using questionnaires                     involving a variety of actual planned purchases, in a large-scale                     experience-sampling study, and in an archival analysis of news stories about                     people waiting in line to make a purchase.

When people see other groups as different, e.g., members of a different race or ethnicity, the perceived boundary often obstructs people from extending trust. This may result in interracial conflicts. The current research argues that individual differences in the lay theory of race can systematically influence the degree to which people extend trust to a racial outgroup in conflict situations. The lay theory of race refers to the extent to which people believe race is a malleable social construct that can change over time (i.e., social constructionist beliefs) versus a fixed essence that differentiates people into meaningful social categories (i.e., essentialist beliefs). In our three studies, we found evidence that social constructionist (vs. essentialist) beliefs promoted interracial trust in intergroup contexts, and that this effect held regardless of whether the lay theory of race was measured (Studies 1 and 3) or manipulated (Study 2), and whether the conflict was presented in a team conflict scenario (Study 1), social dilemma (Study 2), or a face-to-face dyadic negotiation (Study 3). In addition, results revealed that the lay theory's effect on interracial trust could have critical downstream consequences in conflict, namely cooperation and mutually beneficial negotiation outcomes. The findings together reveal that the lay theory of race can reliably influence interracial trust and presents a promising direction for understanding interracial relations and improving intergroup harmony in society.},

  abstract = {Moral licensing describes the phenomenon that displaying moral behavior can lead to subsequent immoral behavior. This is usually explained by the idea that an initial moral act affirms the moral self-image and hence licenses subsequent immoral acts. Previous meta-analyses on moral licensing indicate significant overall effects of d{$>$} .30. However, several large replication studies have either not found the effect or reported a substantially smaller effect size. The present article investigated whether this can be attributed to publication bias. Datasets from two previous meta-analyses on moral licensing were compared and when necessary modified. The larger dataset was used for the present analyses. Using PET-PEESE and a three-parameter-selection-model (3-PSM), we found some evidence for publication bias. The adjusted effect sizes were reduced to d= -0.05, p= .64 and d= 0.18, p= .002, respectively. While the first estimate could be an underestimation, we also found indications that the second estimate might exaggerate the true effect size. It is concluded that both the evidence for and the size of moral licensing effects has likely been inflated by publication bias. Furthermore, our findings indicate that culture moderates the moral licensing effect. Recommendations for future meta-analytic and empirical work are given. Subsequent studies on moral licensing should be adequately powered and ideally pre-registered.},

  abstract = {Frontal asymmetry has been widely used as a marker of emotion, motivation, and psychopathology. When assessed during the resting state, it is regarded as an index of trait approach and withdrawal motivation. However, the replicability of these associations with personality is currently unclear. The present meta-analysis seeks to provide a comprehensive quantitative review of the relationship between personality traits and resting electroencephalographic (EEG) frontal asymmetry. We distinguished five personality clusters: extraversion, neuroticism, impulsivity, anger, and defensiveness. Data from 79 independent samples with overall 5700 participants were included in the meta-analysis. The results revealed that less than 0.4\% of the variance in extraversion and neuroticism could be explained by resting frontal asymmetry. Similarly, a small effect was observed for trait anger, and a small-sized to medium-sized effect was observed for defensiveness, although the number of studies was very low. No significant effect emerged for impulsivity. The effects were further reduced after adjustment for publication bias. Given some evidence for heterogeneity, sub-traits were analysed, and methodological moderators were investigated. Based on the results, we conclude that the validity of resting frontal asymmetry as a marker for personality is not supported. Finally, recommendations are given to increase the replicability of frontal asymmetry research. \textcopyright{} 2019 European Association of Personality Psychology},

In the present research, we identify a frequent consumption activity that is influenced by religiosity: grocery shopping. Using both field and laboratory data, we find that grocery spending decreases with religiosity. Specifically, we document that people who live in more religious U.S. counties spend less money on groceries and make fewer unplanned purchases. We also demonstrate this negative relationship by measuring religiosity at the individual level and employing a religious prime. That is, the more religious people are, the less willing they are to follow through on novel purchase opportunities that arise during their grocery shopping trips. This effect is consistent with the account that many religions emphasize the value of being prudent with money. Additional analysis supports our predicted indirect effect of religiosity on spending through frugality.},

  abstract = {Abstract Glial pathology precedes symptoms of Parkinson's disease and multiple other neurodegenerative diseases. Prolonged impairment of astrocytic functions could increase the vulnerability of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN), accelerate their degeneration and affect ability to compensate for partial degeneration at the presymptomatic stages of the disease. The aim of this study was to investigate the astrocyte depletion in the SN, its impact on the dopaminergic system functioning and multiple markers of energy metabolism during the early stages of neurodegeneration and compensation. We induced death of 30\% of astrocytes by chronic infusion of fluorocitrate (FC) into the SN, simultaneously activating microglia response but sparing the dopaminergic neurons. The FC effect was reversible after toxin withdrawal. Dopaminergic neurons were killed by 6-hydroxydopamine causing transient locomotor disability, reversed with time showing compensatory potential. Death of astrocytes diminished the capability of the dopaminergic system to compensate for the degeneration of neurons and caused a local energy deprivation by decreasing lactate and glycogen amount. Studied markers suggest a shift in the usage of energy substrates, via increased glycogenolysis and glycolysis markers, ketone bodies availability and fatty acid transport in remaining cells. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1{$\alpha$} (PGC-1alpha) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), the energy sensors, showed different regulation between the cell-types. Increased neuronal expression of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1c could play a role in the adaptation to metabolic stress in response to glia dysfunction. Astrocyte energetic support is one of the essential factors for neuronal compensatory mechanisms of dopaminergic system and might have a leading role in the presymptomatic Parkinson's disease stages.

Research on clinical decision making indicates that clinicians' theories of disorders might be personal and inform judgments and choices beyond current scientific theory and evidence. We asked 20 child therapists to draw models of how they believed that biological, psychological, environmental, and behavioral factors interact to cause and maintain four common developmental disorders. They were also asked to judge the effectiveness of interventions recommended in the literature. Therapists showed only fair agreement about the factors and a slight to fair agreement about the causal relations between these, and just fair agreement about interventions' effectiveness. Despite these disagreements, we could predict effectiveness judgments from therapists' personal theories, which indicates that clinicians use personal theories in decision making. We discuss the implications of these findings for evidence-based practice.},

Although there is a long history of research into thought control, the inherent subjectivity of thoughts has made objective examination, and thus mechanistic understanding, difficult. Here, we report a novel method to objectively investigate thought-control success and failure by measuring the sensory strength of visual thoughts using binocular rivalry, a perceptual illusion. Across five experiments (N = 67), we found that thought-control failure may occur because of the involuntary and antithetical formation of nonreportable sensory representations during attempts at thought suppression but not during thought substitution. Notably, thought control was worse in individuals with high levels of anxiety and schizotypy but more successful in mindful individuals. Overall, our study offers insight into the underlying mechanisms of thought control and suggests that individual differences play an important role in the ability to control thoughts.},

We test this theory with data from the American states, which exhibit considerable variation in the sex of state legislative candidates and the high-profile offices of governor and U.S. senator. Using a weighting method and data spanning 1978\textendash 2012, we demonstrate that high-profile women exert substantively large positive effects on female candidates.

The MGPF builds on a statistical approach developed to capture whether individual members of a group develop a shared climate over time, but we extend the core ideas in two important ways. First, we describe how researchers can gain insights into group phenomena such as group leniency, group learning, groupthink, group extremity, group forming, group freezing, and group adjourning through modeling change in latent mean levels and consensus. Second, we present a sequence of model-testing steps that enable researchers to systematically study and contrast different group processes. We describe how the MGPF can lead to novel research questions and illustrate its use in two example data sets.},

In the present article, we examine the role of cognitive flexibility as a correlate of long-term-oriented behaviour in the domain of environmental conservation. In a first study (N = 143), we explored potential associations between multiple self-report scales and performance-based measures of cognitive flexibility and pro-environmental behaviour. Based on its results, we conducted a pre-registered confirmatory study (N = 264) focusing on the most promising correlations found in our exploratory study. This study generated conclusive support for a positive medium-sized correlation between cognitive flexibility and pro-environmental behaviour. Exploratory hierarchical regression analyses further revealed that cognitive flexibility accounted for a small portion of variance in pro-environmental behaviour above and beyond the Big Five. While appearing robust on the level of self-reports, the relationship between cognitive flexibility and pro-environmental behaviour did not reliably extend to the level of performance tasks, possibly because of their relatively specific scope. These results illustrate the contribution of cognitive flexibility to understanding individual differences in long-term-oriented, pro-environmental behaviour. \textcopyright{} 2019 European Association of Personality Psychology},

We disrupted left lPFC function using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and recorded electroencephalography (EEG) before and after. Subjects evaluated the likeability of novel neutral faces after a brief exposure to a happy or fearful face. We found that lPFC inhibition biased evaluations of novel faces according to the previously processed emotional expression. Greater frontal EEG alpha power, reflecting increased inhibition by TMS, predicted increased behavioral bias. TMS-induced affective misattribution was long-lasting: Emotionally biased first impressions formed during lPFC inhibition were still detectable outside of the laboratory 3 days later. These findings indicate that lPFC serves an important emotion-regulation function by preventing incidental emotional encoding from automatically biasing subsequent appraisals.},

Social media and their global use by protesters offer an unprecedented opportunity to observe real-time social ties and online behavior, though often without an attendant measure of real-world behavior. We collect data on Twitter activity during the 2015 Charlie Hebdo protest in Paris, which, unusually, record real-world protest attendance and network structure measured beyond egocentric networks. We devise a test of social theories of protest that hold that participation depends on exposure to others' intentions and network position determines exposure. Our findings are strongly consistent with these theories, showing that protesters are significantly more connected to one another via direct, indirect, triadic, and reciprocated ties than comparable nonprotesters. These results offer the first large-scale empirical support for the claim that social network structure has consequences for protest participation.},

Recent research suggests that perceivers hold target-specific malleability beliefs that certain people, but not others, can change. Six experiments and an internal meta-analysis demonstrate that political orientation operates as a target-specific cue to malleability, with liberals judged as slightly more malleable than conservatives. We test whether target age, gender, and political ideological extremity account for the effect, and find that target ideological extremity independently predicts greater perceived fixedness. A final experiment finds that political prejudice influences malleability beliefs: political outgroup members are judged less favorably than political ingroup members and as a result, are judged to be more fixed. This research contributes to a growing body of work illustrating that some people are believed to be more malleable than others.},

Typically, correcting affective forecasts to include more relevant information improves their accuracy by reducing their extremity. In contrast, we found that providing affective forecasters with social-category information about their targets made their forecasts more extreme and therefore less accurate. In both political and sports contexts, forecasters across five experiments exhibited greater impact bias for both in-group and out-group members (e.g., a Democrat or Republican) than for unspecified targets when predicting experiencers' responses to positive and negative events. Inducing time pressure reduced the extremity of forecasts for group-labeled but not unspecified targets, which suggests that the increased impact bias was due to overcorrection for social-category information, not different intuitive predictions for identified targets. Finally, overcorrection was better accounted for by stereotypes than by spontaneous retrieval of extreme group exemplars.},

In Study 1 (N = 64,228), using a multilevel approach with an international database, we found that older age was associated with lower well-being in countries higher in uncertainty avoidance but not in countries lower in uncertainty avoidance. Further, this cultural variation was mediated by a sense of control.

We call this asymmetry in how average ratings are updated endogenous crowd formation. Using computer simulations, we showed that it implies the emergence of a negative bias in average ratings. This bias affects items with few ratings particularly strongly, which leads to ranking mistakes. The average-rating rankings of items with few ratings are worse than their quality rankings. We found evidence for the predicted pattern of biases in an experiment and in analyses of large online-rating data sets.},

  abstract = {Human and non-human primate studies have examined neural responses to action and inhibition of action. However, it remains unclear whether the cerebral processes supporting these two distinct responses are differentially modulated by reward. In a sample of 35 healthy human adults, we examined brain activations to action and inhibition of action in a reward go/no-go task, with approximately {$\frac{2}{3}$} go and {$\frac{1}{3}$} no-go trials. Correct go and no-go trials were rewarded with \$1 or \textcent 5 in reward sessions. Behaviorally, reward facilitated go and impeded no-go. A conjunction analysis showed shared activation to rewarded go and no-go responses in the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) and inferior parietal cortex. A whole-brain two-way ANOVA of response (go vs no-go) and reward (dollar vs nickel) revealed a significant main effect of response, with greater activity for no-go vs go success in the middle frontal cortex and the reversed pattern in the dorsal ACC, insula, thalamus, and caudate. The thalamus and caudate also responded preferentially to dollar relative to nickel reward during go trials. The main effect of reward (dollar~{$>~$}nickel) involved not only regions associated with reward valuation (e.g., medial orbitofrontal cortex \textendash{} mOFC) but also those implicated in motor control, saliency, and visual attention including the rACC, ventral striatum, insula, and occipital cortex. Finally, the mOFC distinguished go and no-go responses in the dollar but not nickel trials, suggesting a functional bias toward response execution that leads to larger rewards. Together, these findings identified both shared and non-overlapping neural processes underlying goal-directed action and inhibition of action as well as delineated the effects of reward magnitude on such processes.},

Results showed that perceptions of social exchange rule violations accounted for more variance in participants' reactions than the tangible consequences of the event.

There is emerging recognition that ventral temporal object representations are forged via interactions among a broader network of regions that receive independent inputs about a stimulus.

We used transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to stimulate left parietal areas and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to measure object-related neural responses in the ventral stream. We find that representational geometries and category discriminability within ventral temporal cortex, as well as functional connectivity between ventral temporal and parietal areas, are enhanced by anodal compared to cathodal stimulation of left parietal associative cortex. These results demonstrate that ventral temporal representations can be causally modulated by processing distal to the ventral stream.},

Here, we show that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta (PPAR{$\delta$}) decreases BACE1 expression by up-regulating suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. The activation of PPAR{$\delta$} by GW501516, a specific PPAR{$\delta$} agonist, inhibited expression of BACE1. This effect was abrogated by shRNA-mediated knockdown of PPAR{$\delta$} and by treatment with the PPAR{$\delta$} antagonist GSK0660, indicating that PPAR{$\delta$} is involved in GW501516-mediated suppression of BACE1 expression. On the other hand, GW501516-activated PPAR{$\delta$} induced expression of SOCS1, which is a negative regulator of cytokine signal transduction, at the transcriptional level by binding to a PPAR response element in its promoter. This GW501516-mediated induction of SOCS1 expression led to down-regulation of BACE1 expression via inactivation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1. GW501516-activated PPAR{$\delta$} suppressed the generation of neurotoxic amyloid beta (A{$\beta$}) in accordance with the decrease in BACE1 expression. Taken together, these results indicate that PPAR{$\delta$} attenuates BACE1 expression via SOCS1-mediated inhibition of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 signaling, thereby suppressing BACE1-associated generation of neurotoxic A{$\beta$}.},

Although generalisation in property induction and predictive learning tasks share conceptual similarities, it is unknown whether this diversity principle applies to generalisation of a predictive association. We tested this hypothesis in two predictive learning experiments using differential training where one category of stimuli (e.g., fruits) predicted an outcome and another category (e.g., vegetables) predicted no outcome. We compared generalisation between a Non-Diverse group who were presented with non-diverse evidence in both positive (predicted the outcome) and negative (predicted no outcome) categories, and two groups who received the same training as the Non-Diverse group but with a more diverse range of exemplars in the positive (Diverse+ group) or negative (Diverse\textendash{} group) category. Diversity effects were found for both positive and negative categories, in that learning about a diverse range of exemplars increased generalisation of a predictive association to novel exemplars from that same category. The results suggest that diversity, a key principle describing how we reason inductively, also applies to generalisation in associative learning tasks.},

Noting the role of the gut microbiome in host physiology like nutrition and health, it is thus essential to understand how human\textendash wildlife interactions and availability of anthropogenic food in habitats can affect an animal's gut microbiome. This study, therefore, set out to examine the gut microbiota of Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata) with varying accessibility to anthropogenic food and the possibility of using gut microbiota as indicator for macaques' reliance on anthropogenic food. Using 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing, we described the microbial composition of Japanese macaques experiencing different types of human disturbance and anthropogenic food availability\textemdash captive, provisioned, crop-raiding, and wild. In terms of alpha diversity, our results showed that observed richness of gut microbiota did not differ significantly between disturbance types but among collection sites, whereas Shannon diversity index differed by both disturbance types and sites. In terms of beta diversity, captive populations harbored the most distinctive gut microbial composition, and had the greatest difference compared with wild populations. Whereas for provisioned and crop-raiding groups, the macaques exhibited intermediate microbiota between wild and captive. We identified several potential bacterial taxa at different taxonomic ranks whose abundance potentially could help in assessing macaques' accessibility to anthropogenic food. This study revealed the flexibility of the gut microbiome of Japanese macaques and provided possible indices based on the gut microbiome profile in assessing macaques' accessibility to/reliance on anthropogenic foods.},

However, the right hemisphere's ability to appreciate syntactic aspects of language remains poorly understood. In the current study, we used separable, functionally well-characterized electrophysiological indices of lexico-semantic and syntactic processes to demonstrate RH sensitivity to syntactic violations among right-handers with a strong manual preference. Critically, however, the nature of this RH sensitivity to structural information was modulated by a genetically determined factor\textemdash familial sinistrality. The right hemisphere in right-handers without left-handed family members processed syntactic violations via the words' accompanying lexico-semantic unexpectedness. In contrast, the right hemisphere in right-handers with left-handed family members could process syntactic information in a manner qualitatively similar to that of the left hemisphere.},

The nonnative speakers were tested before and after receiving processing instruction on the Spanish passive. The native speakers were tested once and provide a baseline for comparisons. We measured accuracy and response time to select the correct response in a paired picture matching task. We used eye-tracking measures to capture processing behaviors on both active and passive verb forms. We measured processing using time to first fixation on the verb area of interest, mean first fixation duration, mean first pass time, and mean second pass time. The results revealed that processing passive sentences comes at a cost to both native and nonnative speakers. After instruction the nonnative speakers showed no significant differences with native speakers in accuracy and response time. Also, the nonnative speakers' processing behaviors became more nativelike but did not reach the native speaker level.},

Using eye-tracking, it also intended to extend research on the relationship between attention and L2 learning. A pretest\textendash posttest experimental design was employed, with 3 treatment sessions. Forty-eight Korean learners of L2 English were randomly assigned into a captions group (n = 24) and an enhanced captions group (n = 24). For the enhanced captions group, the components of pronominal anaphoric reference were boldfaced in the treatment task input. Learner attention to anaphora antecedents and personal pronouns was assessed with eye-movement indices, and a written and an oral grammaticality judgment test were used to measure learning gains. Textual enhancement succeeded in directing learner attention to the anaphora antecedents, and led to increased gains in receptive knowledge of pronominal anaphoric reference. However, significant links between attention and L2 development were only observed for the unenhanced captions group. The findings, overall, demonstrate that textually enhanced captioning is a useful pedagogical tool to facilitate development in L2 grammatical knowledge.},

However, the cognitive basis of this data-gathering tendency remains unclear. Suggested theories include that delusion-prone individuals gather less data because they (a) misjudge the information value of evidence, (b) find data gathering more taxing than do controls, or (c) make noisier decisions than controls. In the present study we developed a novel, incentivized, nonserial data-gathering task to tease apart these alternatives. Higher delusion-proneness was associated with gathering less information on this task, even when accounting for gender, risk aversion, and intelligence. Our findings suggest that misjudging the information value of evidence contributes substantially to the ``jumping to conclusions'' bias and that neither higher subjective costs nor noisy decision making can fully account for it.},

Participants (N = 1,155) in a community-based, nationwide study answered questions about daily stressors and affect across 8 consecutive days and about their physical health almost 10 years later. Multilevel models indicated that people experience heightened levels of negative affect the day after a stressor occurs. Furthermore, higher levels of lingering negative affect are associated with greater numbers of chronic conditions and worse functional limitations 10 years later. Findings suggest that affective recovery from daily stressors has unique importance for long-term physical health.},

Rather, in loss framing, people are more likely to report the tempting, self-serving information they observed. The results imply that rather than diverting attention away from tempting information, reducing people's motivation to make self-serving mistakes, and framing goals as gains rather than losses are promising ways to decrease the occurrence of self-serving mistakes.

Seven preregistered direct replication attempts of this study were conducted by research teams as part of the Collaborative Replication and Education Project (CREP), and results were meta-analyzed to better understand the strength and consistency of the effects reported in the original study. Half of the original results were clearly supported: Self-esteem negatively predicted perceived safety of self-disclosure on Facebook as compared to face-to-face interactions (meta-analytic effect size = -.28, original effect size = -.31), and self-esteem did not relate to perceived opportunities for self-expression; across the 7 replications, all 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) for effect sizes included 0. However, 2 other findings received less support: Self-esteem only weakly and inconsistently predicted perceived advantages of self-disclosure on Facebook (meta analytic effect size = -.16, original effect size = -.30), and contrary to the original study, there was no evidence for self-esteem predicting perceived opportunities for connection with others on Facebook (6 of the 7 replication effect size CIs contained 0). The results provided further evidence regarding the original study's generalizability and robustness. The implications of the research and its relevance to social compensation theory is presented, and considerations for future multisite replications are proposed.},

This research takes a dyadic approach to understanding how parent and adolescent beliefs influence each other's health behaviors, and how the relationship context of parent-adolescent dyads moderates these effects. Using the Family Life, Activity, Sun, Health, and Eating study (FLASHE), we analyze responses from 1717 parent-adolescent dyads from across the U.S., and explore a dyadic extension to the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). We evaluate how parenting styles that characterize each parent-adolescent dyad moderate the degree to which parents' and adolescents' own attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control are associated with the other person's behaviors across four domains: fruit and vegetable consumption, junk food and sugary drinks consumption, engagement in physical activity, and engagement in screen time sedentary behaviors. We find that the association between parents' attitudes, social norms, and perceived behavioral control and their adolescent's eating behavior tends to be stronger when parents have an authoritative parenting style. However, we also find that the association between adolescents' attitudes, social norms, and perceived behavioral control and their parent's eating behavior tends to be stronger when parents have an authoritative parenting style. These findings show the importance of context in evaluating interpersonal influence, and hold implications for health-relevant interventions.},

Narcissism is characterized by little empathy for the victim, which reduces guilt about one's transgressions. Low guilt, in turn, is associated with unwillingness to apologize. In Study 1, we assessed dispositional narcissism, empathy, guilt, and willingness to apologize. In Study 2, we assessed dispositional narcissism and obtained state measures of empathy, guilt, and willingness to apologize. In Study 3, we manipulated narcissism and collected state measures of empathy, guilt, and willingness to apologize. Narcissism was negatively associated with (Studies 1?2) and decreased (Study 3) willingness to apologize, with this link being explained (i.e., serially mediated) by low empathy and guilt. Finally, in Study 4, we showed that antagonistic narcissism (i.e., narcissistic rivalry), but not agentic narcissism (i.e., narcissistic admiration), was negatively associated with willingness to apologize and apologizing behaviour. In all, narcissists are unwilling to apologize for their transgressions, as they experience little empathy for their victims and lower guilt.

We present a theoretical model that allows for rebel organizations to gain support beyond their ``core'' and build their bargaining power during fighting. We highlight that rebel organizations need to win over crucial parts of society to generate the necessary support that allows them to attain favorable civil conflict outcomes. We find empirical support for the argument that low-income individuals who initially fight the government (rebel organizations) have to convince middle-class individuals to turn out against the government to gain government concessions. Empirically, we demonstrate that government concessions in the form of peace agreements and the onset of negotiations become more likely when protest occurs in the context of civil conflicts.

In multilevel analyses (with n = 2320 domains), perfectionism was related to well-being outcomes similarly at the trait and domain-level. There was more variability across domains in personal standards than in evaluative concerns perfectionism. Variability in personal standards perfectionism was positively related to depression.

Self-critical perfectionism has consistently been linked to poor mental health. The current study compares a diathesis-stress and a downward-spiral model to determine why self-critical perfectionism is detrimental for mental health during this transition. First-year students (N = 658) were recruited before beginning university in August and contacted again in October, January, and April. Participants completed measures on perfectionism, stress, and depressive symptoms. Evidence was found for a downward-spiral model with self-critical perfectionism but not a diathesis-stress model. Students higher in self-critical perfectionism were more likely to experience increased stress and depressive symptoms in a circular and additive manner. Conversely, students higher in personal-standards perfectionism experienced less stress and subsequent depressive symptoms. This research provides a theoretical model for why self-critical perfectionism is related to poor mental-health outcomes that become sustained over time.},

  abstract = {Research summary: Pursuing sources of entrepreneurial and competitive advantage, researchers have been exploring cognition. We examine how cognitive capabilities affect competitive performance, drawing on two constructs rooted in psychology and economics. A familiar one is analytic skill, the ability to solve abstract problems. To that, we add strategic intelligence \textemdash{} the ability to anticipate competitors' behavior and preempt it. Using incentivized experiments, we measure the constructs in participants, then let them compete for cash in a highly competitive market. Although the market is designed to eliminate any advantages, whether from market structure or strategic resources, some profit much more than others. We trace performance differences to heterogeneity in analytic skill and strategic intelligence, and show how the two fuel superior performance, even against tough competition. Managerial summary: Why do some entrepreneurs outperform others? How can companies succeed against tough competition? Certainly, some benefit from unique resources, such as patents, and others can winnow competition, as through mergers. But some have entered highly competitive markets, lacking obvious resources, yet managed to achieve impressive success: think Under Armour, Wal-Mart or Home Depot. Here we test how advantage can stem from managerial cognition. We measure two kinds of cognitive skill in market participants, and then let them vie for cash in intensely competitive markets. Some end up with far more profit than others. Tracing the root of high performance, we find it is predicted by a combination of analytic skills, the ability to solve abstract problems, and strategic intelligence\textemdash ability to anticipate competitors' behavior and preempt it.

We suggest that anchoring is at least partially caused by a desire to avoid making extreme adjustments. In seven studies (N = 5,279), we found that transparently irrelevant cues of extremeness influenced people's adjustments from anchors. In Studies 1\textendash 6, participants were less likely to adjust beyond a particular amount when that amount was closer to the maximum allowable adjustment. For example, in Study 5, participants were less likely to adjust by at least 6 units when they were allowed to adjust by a maximum of 6 units than by a maximum of 15 units. In Study 7, participants adjusted less after considering whether an outcome would be within a smaller distance of the anchor. These results suggest that anchoring effects may reflect a desire to avoid adjustments that feel too extreme.},

  abstract = {Imagine hearing someone call a particular dalmatian a ``dax.'' The meaning of the novel noun dax is ambiguous between the subordinate meaning (dalmatian) and the basic-level meaning (dog). Yet both children and adults successfully learn noun meanings at the intended level of abstraction from similar evidence. Xu and Tenenbaum (2007a) provided an explanation for this apparent puzzle: Learners assume that examples are sampled from the true underlying category (strong sampling), making cases in which there are more observed exemplars more consistent with a subordinate meaning than cases in which there are fewer exemplars (the suspicious-coincidence effect). Authors of more recent work (Spencer, Perone, Smith, \& Samuelson, 2011) have questioned the relevance of this finding, however, arguing that the effect occurs only when the examples are presented to the learner simultaneously. Across a series of 12 experiments (N = 600), we systematically manipulated several experimental parameters that varied across previous studies, and we successfully replicated the findings of both sets of authors. Taken together, our data suggest that the suspicious-coincidence effect in fact is robust to presentation timing of examples but is sensitive to another factor that varied in the Spencer et al. (2011) experiments, namely, trial order. Our work highlights the influence of pragmatics on behavior in experimental tasks.},

  abstract = {Abstract Heat-shock protein B8 (HSPB8) has been recently reported to confer neuroprotection against ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-induced cerebral injury in~vivo and in~vitro. However, the molecular mechanism is still elusive. This study focused on the effect of intracerebroventricular (i.c.v) delivery of lenti-HSPB8 virus against neurological injury in a rat model of cerebral I/R and explored the underlying mechanism. We found that lentivirus i.c.v injection-induced HSPB8 over-expression strongly alleviated infarct volume, improved neurobehavioral outcomes, and reduced brain edema in rat middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R) model. Concomitantly, HSPB8 over-expression noticeably prevented blood?brain barrier (BBB) disruption after cerebral I/R injury as indicated by the reduction in Evans blue leakage and IgG detection in the ipsilateral hemisphere compared with the vehicle group. Moreover, immunoblotting and immunofluorescence staining of tight junction proteins claudin-5 and occludin showed that HSPB8 over-expression prevented the degradation of these proteins induced by MCAO/R, which indicated the protective effect of HSPB8 on BBB. Western blotting and immunostaining techniques were also utilized to analyze the expression of the markers of autophagy. We found that HSPB8 over-expression promoted autophagic flux, evidenced by increased ratio of LC3 I/II, accumulation of Beclin-1 expression and enhanced p62 degradation. i.c.v injection of 15~?g autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA) was applied at the onset of reperfusion. The results showed that 3-MA elicited a significant loss of the protective effect of HSPB8 against MCAO/R-induced neurological defect, Evans blue extravasation, and the loss tight junction proteins, suggesting that the BBB protective role of HSPB8 was, at least in part, mediated through autophagy. Collectively, HSPB8 may represent a potential therapeutic agent for preserving BBB integrity following cerebral I/R injury.

We examine the role of top management team (TMT) functional diversity in influencing Chinese firms' degree of FDI ambidexterity, and its boundary conditions in relation to the informal and formal institutional environments within which the TMT operates. Based on a panel of Chinese outward-investing manufacturing firms, our empirical analyses show that a marginal positive effect of TMT functional diversity on a firm's FDI ambidexterity is strengthened by the social faultline presence in the firm's TMT, but is weakened by the development of formal institutions in the firm's external environment.},

We hypothesized that inhibition HIF-PHD by adaptaquin reduces hypoxic-ischemic brain injury in a neonatal mouse model. The pups were treated intraperitoneally immediately with adaptaquin after hypoxia-ischemia (HI) and then every 24 h for 3 days. Adaptaquin treatment reduced infarction volume by an average of 26.3\% at 72 h after HI compared to vehicle alone, and this reduction was more pronounced in males (34.8\%) than in females (11.7\%). The protection was also more pronounced in the cortex. The subcortical white matter injury as measured by tissue loss volume was reduced by 24.4\% in the adaptaquin treatment group, and this reduction was also more pronounced in males (28.4\%) than in females (18.9\%). Cell death was decreased in the cortex as indicated by Fluoro-Jade labeling, but not in other brain regions with adaptaquin treatment. Furthermore, in the brain injury area, adaptaquin did not alter the number of cells positive for caspase-3 activation or translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor to the nuclei. Adaptaquin treatment increased glutathione peroxidase 4 mRNA expression in the cortex but had no impact on 3-nitrotyrosine, 8-hydroxy-2 deoxyguanosine, or malondialdehyde production. Hif1{$\alpha$} mRNA expression increased after HI, and adaptaquin treatment also stimulated Hif1{$\alpha$} mRNA expression, which was also more pronounced in males than in females. However, nuclear translocation of HIF1{$\alpha$} protein was decreased after HI, and adaptaquin treatment had no influence on HIF1{$\alpha$} expression in the nucleus. These findings demonstrate that adaptaquin treatment is neuroprotective, but the potential mechanisms need further investigation. Read the Editorial Highlight for this article on page 645.},

Without calorie information, the initial integration of health attributes in overweight individuals' decisions was about 230 ms delayed relative to the taste attributes, but calorie labeling promoted healthier choices by speeding up the integration of health attributes during a food-choice task. Our study suggests that obesogenic choices are related to the relative speed with which taste and health attributes are integrated into the decision process and that this bias is modifiable by external health-related cues.},

In this study, we systematically investigated the correspondence between auditory number words and visual Arabic digits in adults. Auditory number words and visual Arabic digits were presented concurrently or sequentially and participants had to indicate whether they described the same quantity. We manipulated the stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs) between the two stimuli (Experiment 1: -500\,ms to +500\,ms; Experiment 2: -200\,ms to +200\,ms). In both experiments, we found a significant cross-modal distance effect. This effect was strongest for simultaneous stimulus presentation and decreased with increasing SOAs. Numerical distance emerged as the most consistent significant predictor overall, in particular for simultaneous presentation. However, physical similarity between the stimuli was often a significant predictor of response times in addition to numerical distance, and at longer SOAs, physical similarity between the stimuli was the only significant predictor. This shows that SOA modulates the extent to which participants access quantity representations. Our results thus support the idea that a semantic quantity representation of auditory and visual numerical symbols is activated when participants perform a concurrent matching task, while at longer SOAs participants are more likely to rely on physical similarity between the stimuli. We also investigated whether individual differences in the efficiency of the cross-modal processing were related to differences in mathematical performance. Our results are inconclusive about whether the efficiency of cross-format numerical correspondence is related to mathematical competence in adults.},

In adult conversations, delays between turns are minimal (typically 200 ms or less) because listeners display a striking ability to predict what their partner will say, and they formulate a response before their partner's turn ends. Here, we tested how this ability to coordinate comprehension and production develops in preschool children. In an interactive paradigm, 106 children (ages 3\textendash 5 years) and 48 adults responded to questions that varied in predictability but were controlled for linguistic complexity. Using a novel distributional approach to data analysis, we found that when children can predict a question's ending, they leave shorter gaps before responding, suggesting that they can optimize the timing of their conversational turns like adults do. In line with a recent ethological theory of turn taking, this early competency helps explain how conversational contexts support language development.},

The experiments reported here addressed this question using a novel paradigm inspired by classic findings on object-based attention. In Experiment 1, participants (N = 18) made lexical decisions about one of two spatially colocated Chinese words or nonwords. Our main finding was that only the attended word's frequency influenced response times and accuracy. In Experiment 2, participants (N = 30) read target words embedded in two spatially colocated Chinese sentences. Our key finding here was that only target-word frequencies influenced looking times and fixation positions. These results support the hypothesis that words are attended in a strictly serial (and perhaps object-based) manner during reading. The theoretical implications of this conclusion are discussed in relation to models of eye-movement control during reading and the conceptualization of words as visual objects.},

  abstract = {Abstract Orexin is a member of neuropeptides which is involved in the central motor control. The substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) is an important nucleus participating in motor control under both physiological and pathological conditions. Morphological studies reveal that orexinergic neurons located in lateral hypothalamus innervate the SNc. Both orexin-1 receptors (OX1R) and orexin-2 receptors (OX2R) are expressed in the SNc. To investigate the effects of orexins on SNc, single unit in~vivo extracellular recordings and behavioral tests were performed in this study. Micro-pressure administration of orexin A and orexin B significantly increased the spontaneous firing rate of nigral DAergic neurons by 65.87~{$\pm~$}7.73\% and 90.49~{$\pm~$}17.83\%, respectively. The excitatory effects of orexin A on nigral DAergic neurons were mainly mediated by OX1R, while OX2R were involved in the increase in firing rate induced by orexin B. Selectively blocking OX1R and OX2R significantly decreased the firing rate of nigral DAergic neurons by 36.77~{$\pm~$}6.26\% and 32.04~{$\pm~$}6.12\%, respectively, which suggested that endogenous orexins modulated the spontaneous firing activity of nigral DAergic neurons. Finally, both elevated body swing test and haloperidol-induced postural behavioral test showed that unilateral microinjection of orexin A and orexin B induced significantly contralateral-biased swing and deflection behavior. Meanwhile, the specific OX1R and OX2R antagonists produced opposite effects. The present electrophysiological and behavioral studies suggested that orexins increased the firing activity of nigral DAergic neurons and participated in central motor control.

In Study 5, we replicated the results of Study 3, which we pre-registered using the Open Science Framework. These findings provided the first evidence of the association between debt and physical burden and indicated that debts affect people similarly to physical burdens.},

  abstract = {Social factors, particularly social norms, have been reported to influence eating behaviors. From the perspective of Social Identity Theory, a strong association between a person and the norm referent group is key to the effectiveness of descriptive social norms on behavior. The general aim of the studies presented in this paper was to examine the effects of descriptive social norm based messages on eating intentions and behaviors, and whether social identity moderates these effects. Study 1 and Study 2 examined whether the effect of a descriptive social norm message promoting vegetable intake (or limiting junk food intake) was moderated by the extent to which participants identified with the norm referent group. We found that centrality of social identification with the norm referent group moderated the effect of descriptive social norm messages on intentions to eat vegetables and intentions to limit junk food intake. Study 3 built on those findings by examining whether priming social identity enhanced the effects of a descriptive social norm message on actual food intake in a laboratory setting. We found that intake of fruit and vegetables was enhanced after exposure to a descriptive social norm message (versus a health message) but this effect was only significant for participants whose identification with the norm referent group had been primed. Taken together, these data add to the suggestion that acting in line with group norms is more likely when individuals regard their membership of the group as being important to their identity.},

In Studies 1a, 1b, 1c, and 2, White participants judged that Black targets were telling the truth more often than they judged that White targets were telling the truth. This truth bias was predicted by Whites' motivation to respond without prejudice. For Black participants, however, motives to respond without prejudice did not moderate responses (Study 2). In Study 3, we found similar effects with a manipulation of the targets' apparent race. Finally, in Study 4, we used eye-tracking techniques to demonstrate that Whites' truth bias for Black targets is likely the result of late-stage correction processes: Despite ultimately judging that Black targets were telling the truth more often than White targets, Whites were faster to fixate on the on-screen ``lie'' response box when targets were Black than when targets were White. These systematic race-based biases have important theoretical implications (e.g., for lie detection and improving intergroup communication and relations) and practical implications (e.g., for reducing racial bias in law enforcement).},

More importantly, affirmatively phrased questions like Which one should I choose?, framed either as an instruction to make the choice or as material unrelated to the study, produced more choice repetition than presenting either no question at all or a control question. In contrast, negatively phrased questions like Which one should I not choose? decreased behavior repetition.

Two studies examine the role of inferred I-sharing in the minimal group paradigm. We found that (1) people inferred that they would I-share with ingroup members more than outgroup members; (2) inferred I-sharing increased ingroup favoritism; and (3) inferred I-sharing accounted for this ingroup favoritism. Moreover, expecting to I-share with the outgroup improved participants' attitudes toward the outgroup. These results converge with other research suggesting that people favor ingroup members, in part, because they expect to I-share with them.},

Anchor precision backfired because experts saw too much precision as reflecting a lack of competence. This negative effect held unless first movers gave rationales that boosted experts' perception of their competence. Statistical mediation and experimental moderation established the critical role of competence attributions. This research disentangles competing theoretical accounts (attribution of competence vs. scale granularity) and qualifies two putative truisms: that anchors affect experts and amateurs equally, and that more precise prices are linearly more potent anchors. The results refine current theoretical understanding of anchoring and have significant implications for everyday life.},

These relations should lead to categorical perception, such that viewers find it easier to notice a change that crosses a category boundary (one object is now above, rather than below, another, or now contains, rather than overlaps with, another) than a change of equal magnitude that does not cross a boundary. We tested the influence of a set of topological categorical relations from the cognitive-modeling literature. In a visual same/different comparison task, viewers more accurately noticed changes that crossed relational category boundaries, compared with changes that did not cross these boundaries. The results highlight the potential of systematic exploration of the boundaries of between-object relational categories.},

Three subsequent experiments involving American and Indian participants established the causal effect of psychologically experiencing a polluted (vs. clean) environment on unethical behavior. Consistent with our theoretical perspective, results revealed that anxiety mediated this effect. Air pollution not only corrupts people's health, but also can contaminate their morality.},

Our results identified two subgroups of thalamic patients with distinct patterns of attentional responsiveness to emotional and colour features in face targets. One group with lesions located in anterior and ventral portions of thalamus showed intact performance, with a normal facilitation of visual search for faces with emotional (fearful or happy) expressions on both side of space, similar to healthy controls. By contrast, a second group showed a slower and poorer detection of face targets, most severe for neutral faces, but with a paradoxically enhanced facilitation by both colour and emotional features. This second group had lesions centred on the pulvinar, involving mainly the dorso-medial sectors in patients showing enhanced effects of colour features, but extending to more dorso-lateral sectors in those with enhanced effects of emotional features. These findings reveal that pulvinar nuclei are not critical for orienting attention to emotionally or visually salient features, but instead provide new evidence in support of previous hypotheses suggesting an important role in controlling attention in visual scenes with distracting information.},

A relevant insight from personality psychology is that facets can predict specific behaviors better than broad traits do. We hypothesized that we could predict physical activity with a facet of conscientiousness related to goal pursuit\textemdash planfulness. We measured the relationship between Planfulness Scale scores and physical activity in 282 individuals over a total of 20 weeks, using a piecewise latent growth curve model. We additionally tested whether planfulness uniquely relates to activity when compared with related constructs. Finally, ratings of participants' written goals were correlated with these personality traits and physical activity. We found that planfulness was positively associated with average visits to a recreational center, that planfulness explained unique variance in activity, and that planfulness correlated with the descriptiveness of written goals. We conclude that the Planfulness Scale is a valid measurement uniquely suited to predicting goal achievement.},

To examine whether different evaluations of stimulus characteristics shape amygdala activation, we conducted a preregistered replication of Cunningham, Van Bavel, and Johnsen's (2008) study demonstrating flexible mapping of amygdala activation to stimulus characteristics, depending on evaluative goals. Participants underwent functional MRI scanning while viewing famous names under three conditions: They were asked to report their overall attitude toward each name, their positive associations only, or their negative associations only. We observed an interaction between condition and rating type, identified as the effect of interest in Cunningham et al. (2008). Specifically, postscan positivity, but not negativity, ratings predicted left amygdala activation when participants were asked to evaluate positive, but not negative, associations with the names. These results provide convergent evidence that cognitive framing, in the form of evaluative goals, can significantly alter whether amygdala activation indexes positivity or negativity.},

In study 1, we used the twin sample from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health IV) data. The results indicated that about 70\% of the association between the Big Five personality traits and perceived stress was due to genetic influences. In study 2, we used the twin sample from the Midlife in the United States Survey (MIDUS I and II) to examine the genetic and environmental influences underlying the longitudinal relations between the Big Five personality traits and perceived stress. The results suggested that continuity in perceived stress was primarily accounted for by genetic influences, and changes in perceived stress were mainly due to nonshared environmental influences. The continuity in the association between the five personality traits and perceived stress was largely accounted for by genetic factors, and nonshared environmental factors made greater contributions to changes in the association between personality traits and perceived stress. Among the Big Five personality traits, the genetic components in conscientiousness and neuroticism made substantial contributions to the genetic link between personality traits and perceived stress across both studies.

We propose that statistical learning is a process through which transitive inferences of new associations are made between objects that have never been directly associated. After viewing a continuous sequence containing two base pairs (e.g., A\textendash B, B\textendash C), participants automatically inferred a transitive pair (e.g., A\textendash C) where the two objects had never co-occurred before (Experiment 1). This transitive inference occurred in the absence of explicit awareness of the base pairs. However, participants failed to infer the transitive pair from three base pairs (Experiment 2), showing the limits of the transitive inference (Experiment 3). We further demonstrated that this transitive inference can operate across the categorical hierarchy (Experiments 4\textendash 7). The findings revealed a novel consequence of statistical learning in which new transitive associations between objects are implicitly inferred.},

The present studies tested the hypotheses that over time, negative, but not positive, group information would generalize to other group members (Experiment 1) and to the self (Experiment 2). In Experiment 1, participants learned personal information about two members of two groups. Two members of one group were associated with negative trait information, while two members of the other group were associated with positive trait information. Participants then made trait and evaluative judgments about members of both groups. In Experiment 2, participants learned positive and negative information about their ingroup and an outgroup. Participants then evaluated themselves on those traits. Results were consistent with hypotheses. Participants generalized negative traits to members of the same group and generalized negative ingroup traits to evaluations of themselves, but only at a long-delay test.},

Our results indicate that violent action by opposition groups consistently increases support for government repression. In the context of contentious politics, we find that the effects of international law vary by national context. While our respondents in India were less likely to approve of their government when told the government violated international law, the same information likely increased approval of the government in our Israel experiment.

Intentional binding (i.e., when voluntary actions and their outcomes are perceived to occur closer together in time than involuntary actions and their outcomes) is increased in intentional action but requires no explicit reflection on agency. The reported experience of involuntariness is central to hypnotic responding, during which strategic action is experienced as involuntary. We report reduced intentional binding in a hypnotically induced experience of involuntariness, providing an objective correlate of reports of involuntariness. We argue that this reduced binding results from the diminished influence of motor intentions in the generation of the sense of agency when beliefs about whether an action is intended are altered. Thus, intentional binding depends on awareness of intentions. This finding shows that changes in metacognition of intentions affect perception.},

The results support a persuasive-matching pattern: A moral appeal was more persuasive than a nonmoral appeal to the extent that initial attitudes were based on moral concerns (i.e., attitudes were moralized), but the opposite was true when initial attitudes had less of a moral basis. Exploratory analyses also showed that these effects were mediated by valenced thoughts about the message and moderated by political orientation.

In the present study, we investigated whether this effect could be attributed to a disruption in the ease with which benchmarks on the number line can be determined and whether this possible disruption changes with age. Hence, we asked 5th graders and adults to perform a NLE task in a typical and an atypical condition with a number line ranging from 0 to 1,000 and from 367 to 1,367, respectively. Results showed that participants' overall estimates were less accurate in the atypical condition compared to the typical condition. A similar pattern of results was observed for the estimates around the self-created benchmarks at 50\% in children and at 25\%, 50\%, and 75\% in adults. Moreover, in both age groups, we found a shift from a larger proportion of estimation patterns' being best fit by more complex power models in the typical condition toward a larger proportion of estimation patterns best described by simpler power models in the atypical condition. Of importance, we also found evidence that adults' estimation patterns in the typical condition are best described by a 4-cycle power model, hereby extending previous modeling results. Overall, our findings indicate that hindering the application of benchmark-based strategies negatively affects children's and adults' NLE performance.

These Bayesian reanalyses allow researchers\textemdash and also editors, reviewers, readers, and reporters\textemdash to (a) quantify evidence on a continuous scale using Bayes factors, (b) assess the robustness of that evidence to changes in the prior distribution, and (c) gauge which posterior parameter ranges are more credible than others by examining the posterior distribution of the effect size.

In this research, we set up strict controls for word frequency and other word properties, to study this knowledge gap. In Experiment 1A and Experiment 1B, a between-subjects design was used. Forty-eight pairs of one- and two-character words were selected as target words in Experiment 1A, while the same amount of two- and three-character words were selected in Experiment 1B. Conversely, a within-subjects design was used in Experiment 2. Sixty sets of one-, two- and three-character words were selected as target words. The results showed that long words were skipped less often and fixated on more often than short words. Total time was shorter for shorter than for longer words but first fixation durations were longer for one- than for two-character words. Most importantly, we did not find reliable evidence to support the view that word length could modulate initial landing position and incoming saccade length in the length-matched region analyses. These findings suggest that word length influences eye movement control during reading Chinese in a way that is slightly different from that in the process of reading English.},

  abstract = {How can people persuade and influence others? One option is to directly target others' behavior through rules and incentives. Another increasingly popular option, however, is to focus on modifying what others think rather than how they behave, and hoping behaviors will then change as a result. The assumption underlying this latter approach is that targeting thoughts and attitudes might be easier or more effective than targeting behaviors. Drawing from psychological reactance theory (Brehm, 1966), we investigate whether efforts targeted at controlling what people think, rather than how they behave, will indeed be met with differing levels of psychological reactance. Across four studies, we find that people experience greater psychological reactance towards efforts to control their thoughts compared to efforts to control their behaviors. Specifically, thought control, compared to behavioral control, led people to experience greater anger and negativity, and to report lowered motivation to engage in requested behaviors (Study 1). These effects occurred, at least in part, because people perceived that those who try to control their thoughts are likely to try to control their behaviors too, but not vice versa. As a result, thought control elicited greater reactance than behavioral control because the former was perceived as more restrictive than the latter (Studies 2 \& 3). We also address other explanations for why thought control may elicit more reactance than behavioral control (Study 4).},

  abstract = {Abstract Research increasingly demonstrates the detrimental effects of psychologically controlling parenting on children's adjustment. An important and practically relevant question is whether some children are more vulnerable for the effects of psychologically controlling parenting. In the current diary study, we investigated whether daily psychologically controlling parenting relates to children's daily externalizing and internalizing problems and whether these associations depend on child personality. A total of 206 children (M age~=~9.93~years; 46.6\% female) along with their mothers and fathers (M age~=~40.30 and 42.40~years) participated in this multi-informant diary study. All three family members filled out a diary each day for seven days. Multilevel analyses indicated that daily maternal and paternal psychological control were positively related to daily externalizing and internalizing problems, a pattern that was fairly consistent across informants. Out of the 35 interactions tested, only three turned out to be significant. Overall, the limited number of interactions suggests that psychologically controlling parenting is generally detrimental to children's daily functioning. Still, children differ somewhat in their susceptibility to the effect of psychologically controlling parenting. ? 2018 European Association of Personality Psychology},

Behavioral studies suggest that such egocentric mental rotations rely on brain areas that are also involved in processing actual self-motion, thus depending on vestibular input. In a combined galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) study, we investigated the brain areas that underlie both simulated changes in self-location and the processing of vestibular stimulation within the same individuals. Participants performed an egocentric mental rotation task, an object-based mental rotation task, or a pure lateralization task during GVS or sham stimulation. At the neural level, we expected an overlap between brain areas activated during vestibular processing and egocentric mental rotation (against object-based mental rotation) within area OP2 and the Posterior Insular Cortex (PIC), two core brain regions involved in vestibular processing. The fMRI data showed a small overlap within area OP2 and a larger overlap within the PIC for both egocentric mental rotation against object-based mental rotation and vestibular processing. GVS did not influence the ability to perform egocentric mental rotation. Our results provide evidence for shared neural mechanisms underlying perceived and simulated self-motion. We conclude that mental rotation of one's body involves neural activity in the PIC and area OP2, but the behavioral results also suggest that those mental simulations of one's body might be robust to modulatory input from vestibular stimulation.},

We implemented a method for assessing nonparametric moderation of psychopathology networks to evaluate differences in network structure across levels of intelligence and emotional control. Symptoms generally clustered by clinical diagnoses, but specific between-cluster bridge connections emerged. Internalizing symptoms demonstrated unique connections with aggression symptoms of interpersonal irritability, whereas externalizing symptoms showed more diffuse interconnections. Aggression symptoms identified as bridge nodes in the cross-sectional network were enriched for longitudinal associations with internalizing symptoms. Cross-domain connections did not significantly vary across intelligence but were weaker at lower emotional control.

Although evidence that language modulates visual discrimination has been accumulating, little is known about the relation between language structure and consciousness. We employed electroencephalography and the attentional-blink paradigm, in which targets are often unnoticed. Native Greek speakers (N = 28), who distinguish categorically between light and dark shades of blue, showed boosted perception for this contrast compared with a verbally unmarked green contrast. Electrophysiological signatures of early visual processing predicted this behavioral advantage. German speakers (N = 29), who have only one category for light and dark shades of blue, showed no differences in perception between blue and green targets. The behavioral consequence of categorical perception was replicated with Russian speakers (N = 46), reproducing this novel finding. We conclude that linguistic enhancement of color contrasts provides targets with a head start in accessing visual consciousness. Our native language is thus one of the forces that determine what we consciously perceive.},

Additionally, upgrading is more likely when lead firms attach a high salience to labor standards. Therefore, while participation in global production induces ``trading up'' behaviors among firms overall, the effect strength varies across industries. We test our expectations via a survey experiment, which queries foreign firms operating in Vietnam about their willingness to invest in labor-related upgrading. We find strong evidence for the effect of markups on upgrading choices and suggestive evidence for the saliency mechanism.},

Recent behavioral data suggest that high-priority items in working memory are more vulnerable to disruption. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to evaluate the hypothesis that prioritization of working memories might impact the recovery of their neural representation(s) after distraction. A delay-period retrospective cue informed participants which of two memory items (a face or a scene) to prioritize during a first delay period. Consistent with prior work, and confirming successful prioritization, multivoxel pattern classifier evidence in perceptual brain regions was higher for cued versus uncued memory items. A distraction task was then imposed before a second retrospective cue informed participants to either ``stay'' remembering the previously cued item or ``switch'' to the previously uncued item. This allowed for the evaluation of recovery for high-priority items (on stay trials) and also low-priority items (on switch trials). Classifiers showed successful reinstatement of both high- and low-priority items after distraction, but only low-priority items recovered to their pre-distraction representational levels. Moreover, the degree of prioritization before distraction predicted the amount of disruption for high-priority items after distraction, suggesting that the more a participant prioritized the cued item, the greater the impact of distraction. Our data provide neural evidence that prioritizing working memory information in perceptual regions makes that information more vulnerable to disruption.},

Determining whether this process is characterized by tonotopic maps in primary or secondary auditory areas, with bilateral or leftward activity, remains a long-standing challenge. Magnetoencephalographic studies failed to show hierarchical and asymmetric hints for speech processing. We employed high-density electroencephalography to map the Salento Italian vowel system onto cortical sources using the N1 auditory evoked component. We found evidence that the N1 is characterized by hierarchical and asymmetrical indexes in primary and secondary auditory areas structuring vowel representations. Importantly, the N1 was characterized by early and late phases. The early N1 peaked at 125\textendash 135~msec and was localized in the primary auditory cortex; the late N1 peaked at 145\textendash 155~msec and was localized in the left superior temporal gyrus. We showed that early in the primary auditory cortex, the cortical spatial arrangements\textemdash along the lateral-medial and anterior-posterior gradients\textemdash are broadly warped by phonemotopic patterns according to the distinctive feature principle. These phonemotopic patterns are carefully refined in the superior temporal gyrus along the inferior-superior and anterior-posterior gradients. The dynamical and hierarchical interface between primary and secondary auditory areas and the interaction effects between Height and Place features generate the categorical representation of the Salento Italian vowels.},

Participants were 212 women who completed surveys at both 2 and 12 months after the shooting. Using within-group permutation tests, we found that overall network strength significantly increased and overall network structure significantly changed. Several symptoms saw marked alterations in their network centrality and relations to other symptoms. Psychological reactivity at reminders was the most central symptom at 2 months but among the least central at 12 months. By contrast, reliving, anhedonia, and physiological reactivity had low centrality at 2 months but high centrality at 12 months. Findings broadly support memory-based and fear-conditioning accounts of PTSD and suggest that automatic situationally cued symptoms, including reliving, thought avoidance, and physiological reactions, become more central to the network over time.},

  abstract = {Abstract Several subtypes of modulatory neurons co-express vesicular glutamate transporters (VGLUTs) in addition to their cognate vesicular transporters. These neurons are believed to establish new forms of neuronal communication. The atypical VGLUT3 is of particular interest since in the striatum this subtype is found in tonically active cholinergic interneurons (TANs) and in a subset of 5-HT fibers. The striatum plays a major role in psychomotor effects induced by amphetamine. Whether and how VGLUT3-operated glutamate/ACh or glutamate/5HT co-transmissions modulates psychostimulants-induced maladaptive behaviors is still unknown. Here, we investigate the involvement of VGLUT3 and glutamate co-transmission in amphetamine-induced psychomotor effects and stereotypies. Taking advantage of constitutive and cell-type specific VGLUT3-deficient mouse lines, we tackled the hypothesis that VGLUT3 could gate psychomotor effects (locomotor activity and stereotypies) induced by acute or chronic administration of amphetamine. Interestingly, VGLUT3-null mice demonstrated blunted amphetamine-induced stereotypies as well as reduced striatal ?FosB expression. VGLUT3-positive varicosities within the striatum arise in part from 5HT neurons. We tested the involvement of VGLUT3 deletion in serotoninergic neurons in amphetamine-induced stereotypies. Mice lacking VGLUT3 specifically in 5HT fibers showed no alteration to amphetamine sensitivity. In contrast, specific deletion of VGLUT3 in cholinergic neurons partially phenocopied the effects observed in the constitutive knock-out mice. Our results show that constitutive deletion of VGLUT3 modulates acute and chronic locomotor effects induced by amphetamine. They point to the fact that the expression of VGLUT3 in multiple brain areas is pivotal in gating amphetamine-induced psychomotor adaptations.

We additionally demonstrated that Catholic collective narcissism predicted outgroup hostility, and this effect was mediated by gender conspiracy beliefs.

  abstract = {Despite its critical role for the development of the field, little is known about replication in second language (L2) research. To better understand replication practice, we first provide a narrative review of challenges related to replication, drawing on recent developments in psychology. This discussion frames and motivates a systematic review, building on syntheses of replication in psychology, education, and L2 research. We coded 67 self-labeled L2 replication studies found across 26 journals for 136 characteristics. We estimated a mean rate of 1 published replication study for every 400 articles, with a mean of 6.64 years between initial and replication studies and a mean of 117 citations of the initial study before a replication was published. Replication studies had an annual mean of 7.3 citations, much higher than averages in linguistics and education. Overlap in authorship between initial and replication studies and the availability of the initial materials both increased the likelihood of a replication supporting the initial findings. Our sample contained no direct (exact) replication attempts, and changes made to initial studies were numerous and wide ranging, which likely obscured, if not undermined, the interpretability of replication studies. To improve the amount and quality of L2 replication research, we propose 16 recommendations relating to rationale, nomenclature, design, infrastructure, and incentivization for collaboration and publication.

The integration-segregation hypothesis (Lupi\'a\~nez, 2010) suggests that peripheral cues always produce an onset-detection cost regardless the behavioral cueing effect that is measured \textendash{} either facilitation or IOR. In the present study, we used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to investigate the causal contribution of this detection cost to performance. We used a cueing paradigm with a target discrimination task that was preceded by a non-informative peripheral cue. The presence-absence of a central intervening event was manipulated. Online TMS to the left superior parietal lobe (compared to an active vertex stimulation) lead to an overall more positive effect (faster responses for cued as compared to uncued trials), by putatively impairing the detection cost contribution to performance. The data revealed a strong association between overall RT and the TMS effect, and also between overall RT and the integrity of the first branch of the left superior longitudinal fascicule. These results have critical implications not only for the open debate about the mechanism/s underlying spatial orienting effects, but also for the growing literature demonstrating that white matter connectivity is crucial for explaining inter-individual behavioral variability.},

  abstract = {Abstract As the peripheral sympathoadrenal axis is tightly controlled by the cortex via hypothalamus and brain stem, the central pathological features of Hunting's disease, (HD) that is, deposition of mutated huntingtin and synaptic dysfunctions, could also be expressed in adrenal chromaffin cells. To test this hypothesis we here present a thorough investigation on the pathological and functional changes undergone by chromaffin cells (CCs) from 2-month (2~m) to 7-month (7~m) aged wild-type (WT) and R6/1 mouse model of Huntington's disease (HD), stimulated with acetylcholine (ACh) or high [K+] (K+). In order to do this, we used different techniques such as inmunohistochemistry, patch-clamp, and amperometric recording. With respect to WT cells, some of the changes next summarized were already observed in HD mice at a pre-disease stage (2~m); however, they were more pronounced at 7~m when motor deficits were clearly established, as follows: (i) huntingtin over-expression as nuclear aggregates in CCs; (ii) smaller CC size with decreased dopamine ?-hydroxylase expression, indicating lesser number of chromaffin secretory vesicles; (iii) reduced adrenal tissue catecholamine content; (iv) reduced Na+ currents with (v) membrane hyperpolarization and reduced ACh-evoked action potentials; (v) reduced [Ca2+]c transients with faster Ca2+ clearance; (vi) diminished quantal secretion with smaller vesicle quantal size; (vii) faster kinetics of the exocytotic fusion pore, pore expansion, and closure. On the basis of these data, the hypothesis is here raised in the sense that nuclear deposition of mutated huntingtin in adrenal CCs of R6/1 mice could be primarily responsible for poorer Na+ channel expression and function, giving rise to profound depression of cell excitability, altered Ca2+ handling and exocytosis.

  abstract = {Cerebral ischemia is the second most common cause of death and a major cause of disability worldwide. Available therapies are based only on anticoagulants or recombinant tissue plasminogen activator. Extracellular adenosine increases during ischemia and acts as a neuroprotective endogenous agent mainly by activating adenosine A1 receptors (A1Rs) which control calcium influx, glutamate release, membrane potential, and metabolism. Accordingly, in many experimental paradigms it has been already demonstrated that the stimulation of A1R with full agonists is able to reduce ischemia-related structural and functional brain damage; unfortunately, cardiovascular side effects and desensitization of A1R induced by these compounds have strongly limited their exploitation in stroke therapy so far. Among the newly emerging compounds, A1R partial agonists could be almost free of side effects and equally effective. Therefore, we decided to evaluate the neuroprotective potential of two A1R partial agonists, namely 2{${'}$}-dCCPA and 3{${'}$}-dCCPA, in in vitro and ex vivo experimental models of cerebral ischemia. Within the experimental paradigm of oxygen-glucose deprivation in vitro in human neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cells both A1R partial agonists increased cell viability. Considering the high level of expression of A1Rs in the hippocampus and the susceptibility of CA1 region to hypoxia, we performed electrophysiological experiments in this subfield. The application of 7 min of oxygen-glucose deprivation constantly produces an irreversible synaptic failure in all the C57Bl/6 mice hippocampal slices evaluated; both tested compounds allowed a significant recovery of synaptic transmission. These findings demonstrate that A1R and its partial agonists are still of interest for cerebral ischemia therapy.

  abstract = {Abstract Many longitudinal studies have investigated whether self-esteem predicts depressive symptoms (vulnerability model) or the other way around (scar model) in adolescents. The most common method of analysis has been the cross-lagged panel model (CLPM). The CLPM does not separate between-person effects from within-person effects, making it unclear whether the results from previous studies actually reflect the within-person effects or whether they reflect differences between people. We investigated the associations between self-esteem and depressive symptoms at the within-person level, using random intercept cross-lagged panel models (RI-CLPMs). To get an impression of the magnitude of possible differences between the RI-CLPM and the CLPM, we compared the results of both models. We used data from three longitudinal adolescent samples (age range: 7?18~years; study 1: N~=~1948; study 2: N~=~1455; study 3: N~=~316). Intervals between the measurements were 1?1.5~years. Single-paper meta-analyses showed support for small within-person associations from self-esteem to depressive symptoms, but not the other way around, thus only providing some support for the vulnerability model. The cross-lagged associations in the aggregated RI-CLPM and CLPM showed similar effect sizes. Overall, our results show that over 1- to 1.5-year time intervals, low self-esteem may negatively influence depressive symptoms over time within adolescents, but only weakly so. ? 2018 The Authors.

  abstract = {Past empirical work suggests that aging is associated with decreases in risk taking. But are such effects universal? Life-history theory suggests that the link between age and risk taking is a function of specific reproductive strategies that can be more or less risky depending on the ecology. We assessed variation in the age-risk curve using World Values Survey data from 77 countries (N = 147,118). The results suggest that propensity for risk taking tends to decline across the life span in the vast majority of countries. In addition, there is systematic variation among countries: Countries in which hardship (e.g., high infant mortality) is higher are characterized by higher levels of risk taking and flatter age-risk curves. These findings suggest that hardship may function as a cue to guide life-history strategies. Age-risk relations thus cannot be understood without reference to the demands and affordances of the environment.},

  abstract = {Object identification is driven, in part, by the extent to which we have sensorimotor experience with the object. Importantly, the activation of embodied object representations depends on contextual information. In the present study, we use a visual masking paradigm to investigate how the availability of visual information modulates the role of manipulability in the representation of object concepts. Using both an object naming task (i.e., linguistic response) and a picture-word matching task (i.e., manual response), we provide evidence that structural manipulability (the ability to pick up an object with one hand) and functional manipulability (the action information that pertains to the ultimate use of the object) have dissociable effects on object identification. In both tasks, the effects of structural manipulability were greater when structural information was available in the image (i.e., when the objects were unmasked); in contrast, the effects of functional manipulability were greater when the objects were masked. Importantly, these effects were not due to object familiarity or the age at which the name of the objects was acquired. Our results are consistent with the activation of the two pathways within the dorsal visual stream that are part of a distributed neural network that represents embodied action information. We extend previous research by showing that visual information determines which type of embodied information drives object identification.

To test this latter prediction, we measured pupillary responses to single words that conveyed a sense of brightness (e.g., day) or darkness (e.g., night) or were neutral (e.g., house). We found that pupils were largest for words conveying darkness, of intermediate size for neutral words, and smallest for words conveying brightness. This pattern was found for both visually presented and spoken words, which suggests that it was due to the words' meanings, rather than to visual or auditory properties of the stimuli. Our findings suggest that word meaning is sufficient to trigger a pupillary response, even when this response is not imposed by the experimental task, and even when this response is beyond voluntary control.},

However, empirical evidence for this proposition is mixed. In this article, we clarify competing theories, elucidate their implications for public opinion, and describe the results of a series of survey experiments designed to evaluate whether and why there is a hawk's advantage. We find that hawks are indeed better positioned domestically to initiate rapprochement than doves. We also find support for two key causal mechanisms: Voters are more confident in rapprochement when it is pursued by a hawk and are more likely to view hawks who initiate conciliation as moderates. Further, the hawk's advantage persists whether conciliatory efforts end in success or failure. Our microfoundational evidence thus suggests a pronounced domestic advantage for hawks who deliver the olive branch.},

In total, 234 participants self-reported contact and prejudice against these outgroups and completed RWA and SDO scales. Contact predicted less prejudice against lesbians and gay men and Indigenous Australians in participants high in RWA and participants high in SDO. However, contact only predicted less prejudice against people with schizophrenia in participants low in RWA or SDO.

I argue that social movements can not only beget institutional change, but also long-run, attitudinal change. Using the case of the U.S. civil rights movement, I develop a theory in which protests can shift attitudes and these attitudes can persist. Data from over 150,000 survey respondents provide evidence consistent with the theory. Whites from counties that experienced historical civil rights protests are more likely to identify as Democrats and support affirmative action, and less likely to harbor racial resentment against blacks. These individual-level results are politically meaningful?counties that experienced civil rights protests are associated with greater Democratic Party vote shares even today. This study highlights how social movements can have persistent impacts on a nation's politics.},

Researchers have observed considerable covariation among these and other economic games, leading them to assert that there exists a general human propensity to cooperate that varies in strength across individuals and manifests itself across a variety of social settings. To formalize this hypothesis, we created an S-1 bifactor model using 276 participants' Dictator Game and Trust Game decisions. The general factor had significant, moderate associations with self-reported and peer-reported altruism, trust, and trustworthiness. Thus, the positive covariation among economic games is not reducible to the games' shared situational features. Two hundred participants returned for a second session. The general factor based on Dictator Game and Trust Game decisions from this session did not significantly predict self-reported and peer-reported cooperation, suggesting that experience with economic games causes them to measure different traits from those that are reflected in self-assessments and peer-assessments of cooperativeness. \textcopyright{} 2018 European Association of Personality Psychology},

  abstract = {Srull and Wyer (1979) demonstrated that exposing participants to more hostility-related stimuli caused them subsequently to interpret ambiguous behaviors as more hostile. In their Experiment 1, participants descrambled sets of words to form sentences. In one condition, 80\% of the descrambled sentences described hostile behaviors, and in another condition, 20\% described hostile behaviors. Following the descrambling task, all participants read a vignette about a man named Donald who behaved in an ambiguously hostile manner and then rated him on a set of personality traits. Next, participants rated the hostility of various ambiguously hostile behaviors (all ratings on scales from 0 to 10). Participants who descrambled mostly hostile sentences rated Donald and the ambiguous behaviors as approximately 3 scale points more hostile than did those who descrambled mostly neutral sentences. This Registered Replication Report describes the results of 26 independent replications (N = 7,373 in the total sample; k = 22 labs and N = 5,610 in the primary analyses) of Srull and Wyer's Experiment 1, each of which followed a preregistered and vetted protocol. A random-effects meta-analysis showed that the protagonist was seen as 0.08 scale points more hostile when participants were primed with 80\% hostile sentences than when they were primed with 20\% hostile sentences (95\% confidence interval, CI = [0.004, 0.16]). The ambiguously hostile behaviors were seen as 0.08 points less hostile when participants were primed with 80\% hostile sentences than when they were primed with 20\% hostile sentences (95\% CI = [-0.18, 0.01]). Although the confidence interval for one outcome excluded zero and the observed effect was in the predicted direction, these results suggest that the currently used methods do not produce an assimilative priming effect that is practically and routinely detectable.},

Research suggests that this effect owes its influence to a serial process in which participants' perception of the risk involved in voicing internal criticism leads to an increase in the perceived credibility of the speaker. The credibility makes it possible for the speaker to be viewed as open-minded, which subsequently inspires greater hope. This process culminates in an increased openness to the outgroup. These findings have been restricted to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but here we examine their generalizability to racial conflict in the United States. Results reveal that White Americans exposed to internal criticism expressed by a Black authority figure express greater openness to African-American perspectives on race relations and are more willing to support policies of racial equality. Replicating past research, this effect is serially mediated by risk, credibility, and hope.},

  abstract = {We present a meta-analysis of the effects of visuomotor adaptation to leftward displacing prisms on visuospatial judgements in healthy people, as assessed by perceptual (landmark) and manual versions of the line bisection task. To supplement previously published datasets, we report two novel experiments: Experiment 1 (n~=~12) found null effects of adaptation to 10\textdegree{} leftward prisms on spatial bias in the landmark task, and Experiment 2 (n~=~24) found null effects of 12\textdegree{} leftward prisms on spatial bias in a computerised line bisection task. Including these data, we considered 17 experiments for the landmark task (total n~=~256), and 12 experiments for line bisection (total n~=~172), in which participants were adapted for between 7 and 20~min to prism strengths from 8 to 17\textdegree. A random-effects meta-analysis, with prism strength and exposure duration as moderators, confirmed robust rightward shifts in visuospatial judgements following leftward prism adaptation. The average standardised effect sizes (Cohen's d) were similar between tasks, increasing by around .1 per degree of prismatic displacement, and being boosted by a long (10~min +) period of prism exposure. However, the quality of evidence and precision of prediction was superior for the landmark task, with a higher signal-to-noise ratio within studies, and less heterogeneity between studies. We suggest that line bisection responses may be contaminated by sensorimotor aftereffects, and that the landmark task is a more suitable method for measuring true visuospatial aftereffects of prism adaptation. To harness these effects, we recommend that researchers should expose participants to 15\textdegree{} (or higher) leftward prisms for more than ten minutes, with upwards of 250 pointing movements. Power calculations should take account of heterogeneity in the true effect size between studies; and further investigation of the factors underlying this heterogeneity will help to refine optimally-effective methods.},

We asked 5- and 6-year-old children to describe the actions of interacting geometric shapes and manipulated whether the children believed these shapes represented their own group or another group. Children of both ages spontaneously used mental-state words more often in their description of in-group members compared with out-group members. Furthermore, 6-year-olds produced a greater diversity of mental-state terms when talking about their own social group. These effects held across two different social categories (based on gender and geographic location). This research has important implications for understanding a broad range of social phenomena, including dehumanization, intergroup bias, and theory of mind.},

Sixty-nine English-speaking learners of L2 French undertook either: (a) a `core' treatment of EI about the L2 with L2 comprehension practice, (b) the same L2 core + L1 comprehension practice, (c) the same L2 core + L1 comprehension practice + EI about L1, or (d) outcome tests only. Results showed that providing additional EI about the L1 benefitted the accuracy of oral production immediately after the instruction and then 6 weeks later. These results suggest that tailoring instruction, specifically the nature of the EI, to the nature of the learning problem can facilitate L2 learning. In particular, EI about L1 can facilitate L2 learning by increasing learners' awareness of similarities and differences in how L1 and L2 express the same meanings.},

Participants heard isolated fricatives (e.g., ``s,'' ``sh'') and predicted the upcoming vowel. Accuracy was above chance, which suggests that fine-grained detail in the signal can be used for prediction. A second group performed the same task but also saw a still face and a letter corresponding to the fricative. This group performed markedly better, which suggests that high-level knowledge modulates prediction by helping listeners form expectations about what the fricative should have sounded like. This suggests a form of data explanation operating in speech perception: Listeners account for variance due to their knowledge of the talker and current phoneme, and they use what is left over to make more accurate predictions about the next sound.},

We then tested the infants' selective attention to two novel individuals after one sang the familiar song and the other sang the unfamiliar song. Infants who had experienced a parent singing looked longer at the new person who had sung the familiar melody than at the new person who had sung the unfamiliar melody, and the amount of song exposure at home predicted the size of that preference. Neither effect was observed, however, among infants who had heard the song emanating from a toy or being sung by a socially unrelated person, despite these infants' remarkable memory for the familiar melody, tested an average of more than 8 months later. These findings suggest that melodies produced live and experienced at home by known social partners carry social meaning for infants.},

In Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), a rare disorder of genomic imprinting, genes from chromosome 15q11\textendash q13 that are typically paternally expressed are unexpressed, which results in exaggeration of traits that reduce offspring's investment demands on the mother. PWS may thus be associated with a distinctive musical phenotype. We report unusual responses to music in people with PWS. Subjects with PWS (N = 39) moved more during music listening, exhibited greater reductions in heart rate in response to music listening, and displayed a specific deficit in pitch-discrimination ability relative to typically developing adults and children (N = 589). Paternally expressed genes from 15q11\textendash q13, which are unexpressed in PWS, may thus increase demands for music and enhance perceptual sensitivity to music. These results implicate genomic imprinting in the psychology of music, informing theories of music's evolutionary history.},

I attempted to conceptually replicate and extend this effect. In Study 1, 755 participants received a Christmas card supposedly from a more- versus less-similar stranger. The reciprocation rate was unexpectedly low (2\%), which did not allow for a test of a similarity effect. Two potential reasons for this low rate were examined in Study 2 in which 494 participants reported their likelihood of reciprocating a Christmas card from a stranger as well as their felt suspicions/threat about the card and their frequency of e-mail use. Reciprocation likelihood was negatively correlated with perceived threat/suspicion and e-mail use. It appears that reciprocating a gift from a stranger in offline settings may be less likely than expected.},

Our paper provides evidence of a link between an organization's culture\textemdash specifically the trust environment\textemdash and its level of specialization. We show experimentally that exogenously-imposed culture endogenously leads to variation in organizational form. We prime trust and demonstrate that the level of trust within an organization affects division of labor and consequently productivity in nonhierarchical teams. This evidence is consistent with a cross-country link between trust and the division of labor that we observe in data from the European Social Survey. Managerial Summary Firms vary among many dimensions such as culture and internal organization even within the same industry. Trust is one component of corporate culture that is crucial for cooperation within organizations. In this paper, we show that the trust dimension of corporate culture can affect firm performance through internal structure, in particular the degree of division of labor. Using evidence from a game-theoretic model, a lab experiment, and country-level data, we show that an increase in trust leads to increased worker specialization. Our results suggest that increasing trust in work environments where division of labor is beneficial is one way to boost team productivity.

  abstract = {Multisensory perception is regarded as one of the most prominent examples where human behaviour conforms to the computational principles of maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). In particular, observers are thought to integrate auditory and visual spatial cues weighted in proportion to their relative sensory reliabilities into the most reliable and unbiased percept consistent with MLE. Yet, evidence to date has been inconsistent. The current pre-registered, large-scale (N~=~36) replication study investigated the extent to which human behaviour for audiovisual localization is in line with maximum likelihood estimation. The acquired psychophysics data show that while observers were able to reduce their multisensory variance relative to the unisensory variances in accordance with MLE, they weighed the visual signals significantly stronger than predicted by MLE. Simulations show that this dissociation can be explained by a greater sensitivity of standard estimation procedures to detect deviations from MLE predictions for sensory weights than for audiovisual variances. Our results therefore suggest that observers did not integrate audiovisual spatial signals weighted exactly in proportion to their relative reliabilities for localization. These small deviations from the predictions of maximum likelihood estimation may be explained by observers' uncertainty about the world's causal structure as accounted for by Bayesian causal inference.},

This article examines the effects of efforts by LEOs to persuade voters to return mailed ballots before Election Day and in person in order to facilitate the efficient administration of vote-by-mail elections in Colorado. Field experiments testing the efficacy of alternative messages find that many messages have no effect on the timing or method of ballot return. Messaging that focuses on LEOs' responsiveness to voters' demands is most effective at steering voters to return their mailed ballots in person but results in later ballot returns.},

Although several explanations of this phenomenon have been proposed, we identify an overlooked asymmetry in information about new and old items that emerges when people seek positive experiences and learn about the qualities of (noisy) alternatives by experiencing them. The reason for the asymmetry is that people avoid rechoosing alternatives that previously led to poor outcomes; hence, additional feedback on their qualities is precluded. Negative quality estimates, even when caused by noise, thus tend to persist. This negative bias takes time to develop, and affects old alternatives more strongly than similar but newer alternatives. We analyze a simple learning model and demonstrate the process by which people would tend to evaluate a new alternative more positively than an older alternative with the same payoff distribution. The results from two experimental studies (Ns = 769 and 805) support the predictions of our model.},

Results showed that successfully avoiding biased responding on conflict items across both age groups was associated with increased activation in Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC) and the right Lateral Prefrontal Cortex (LPFC) regions of interest.

  abstract = {How do children begin to use language to say things they have never heard before? The origins of linguistic productivity have been a subject of heated debate: Whereas generativist accounts posit that children's early language reflects the presence of syntactic abstractions, constructivist approaches instead emphasize gradual generalization derived from frequently heard forms. In the present research, we developed a Bayesian statistical model that measures the degree of abstraction implicit in children's early use of the determiners ``a'' and ``the.'' Our work revealed that many previously used corpora are too small to allow researchers to judge between these theoretical positions. However, several data sets, including the Speechome corpus\textemdash a new ultra-dense data set for one child\textemdash showed evidence of low initial levels of productivity and higher levels later in development. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that children lack rich grammatical knowledge at the outset of language learning but rapidly begin to generalize on the basis of structural regularities in their input.},

  abstract = {For decades, social psychologists have examined the concept of behavioral expectancies, also known as self-fulfilling prophecies, and the long-lasting impact that they can have on individuals' lives. The reversal of such expectancy effects has received much less attention. The present study focused on the questions of how stable behavioral tendencies elicited via self-fulfilling prophecies are, and the ease, or difficulty, with which expectancycongruent behavioral tendencies can be reversed. To examine these questions, participants completed varying numbers of computerized reaction time tasks against computer opponents. Participants first played 1, 3, or 5 games against opponents who treated them with hostility, followed by a single game against an opponent who treated them with kindness, and finally played against an opponent who displayed neutral behavior toward them. We predicted that the more times participants played against a hostile opponent, the more difficult it would be for the participants to reduce expectancy-congruent hostile behavior through interaction with an opponent who treated them with kindness. Contrary to our prediction, participants who played the most games against hostile opponents before being exposed to a kind opponent were significantly kinder to the final neutral opponent than were other participants who received less hostile treatment (p = .002). These results suggest that it may be possible to counteract the negative effects of behavioral expectancies in some cases. Discussion centers on examining connections between this work and scholarship on empathy and altruism, as well as a consideration of future directions suggested by the results.},

  abstract = {Neurotoxicology is hampered by the inability to predict regional and cellular targets of toxicant-induced damage. Evaluating astrogliosis overcomes this problem because reactive astrocytes highlight the location of toxicant-induced damage. While enhanced expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein is a hallmark of astrogliosis, few other biomarkers have been identified. However, bacterial artificial chromosome - translating ribosome affinity purification (bacTRAP) technology allows for characterization of the actively translating transcriptome of a particular cell type; use of this technology in aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family member L1 (ALDH1L1) bacTRAP mice can identify genes selectively expressed in astrocytes. The aim of this study was to characterize additional biomarkers of neurotoxicity-induced astrogliosis using ALDH1L1 bacTRAP mice. The known dopaminergic neurotoxicant 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP; 12.5 mg/kg s.c.) was used to induce astrogliosis. Striatal tissue was obtained 12, 24, and 48 h following exposure for the isolation of actively translating RNA. Subsequently, MPTP-induced changes in this RNA pool were analyzed by microarray and 184 statistically significant, differentially expressed genes were identified. The dataset was interrogated by gene ontology, pathway, and co-expression network analyses, which identified novel genes, as well as those with known immune and inflammatory functions. Using these analyses, we were directed to several genes associated with reactive astrocytes. Of these, TIMP1 and miR-147 were identified as candidate biomarkers because of their robust increased expression following both MPTP and trimethyl tin exposures. Thus, we have demonstrated that bacTRAP can be used to identify new biomarkers of astrogliosis and aid in the characterization of astrocyte phenotypes induced by toxicant exposures.

  abstract = {Retrieval practice and spacing are two factors shown to enhance learning in basic psychological research. The present study investigated the clinical applicability of these factors to naming treatment in aphasia. Prior studies have shown that naming treatment that provides retrieval practice (i.e., practice retrieving names for objects from semantic memory) improves later naming performance in people with aphasia (PWA) more so than repetition training. Repetition training is a common form of naming treatment that can support errorless production of names for objects, but it does not provide retrieval practice. Prior work has also demonstrated enhanced naming treatment benefit in PWA when an item's training trials are separated by multiple intervening trials (i.e., spacing) compared to only one intervening trial (i.e., massing). However, in those studies, items were only trained in one session. Also, the effects of the learning factors were probed after one day and one week. The goal of the present study was to examine the effects of retrieval practice and spacing in a more clinically-inspired schedule of delivery and to assess the effects of the learning factors at retention intervals of greater functional significance. Matched sets of errorful items for each of four PWA were presented for multiple trials of retrieval practice or repetition in a spaced or massed schedule in each of multiple training sessions. Mixed regression analyses revealed that retrieval practice outperformed repetition, and spacing outperformed massing, at an initial post-treatment test administered after one week. Furthermore, the advantage for retrieval practice over repetition persisted at a follow-up test administered after one month. The potential clinical relevance of retrieval practice and spacing for multi-session interventions in speech-language treatment is discussed.},

This condition is characterized by an overwhelming exhaustion related to one's parental role, an emotional distancing from one's children, and a sense of parental ineffectiveness. Researchers have begun to document the antecedents of parental burnout, but little is known about its consequences. Here we investigated the impact of parental burnout on escape ideation, parental neglect, and parental violence through two cross-lagged longitudinal studies (N = 918, N = 822) that involved the completion of online surveys three times over a year. Results indicated that parental burnout strongly increases escape ideation as well as neglectful and violent behaviors toward one's children (aggregated Cohen's d = 1.31, 1.25, and 1.25, respectively). These findings show that parental burnout is a serious condition that urgently requires more attention.},

To test the robustness of these effects in a larger and more diverse sample, we used Bayesian integrative data analysis to pool data on subjective life satisfaction and observed daily conversations from three heterogeneous adult samples, in addition to the original sample (N = 486). We found moderate associations between life satisfaction and amount of alone time, conversation time, and substantive conversations, but no reliable association with small talk. Personality did not substantially moderate these associations. The failure to replicate the original small-talk effect is theoretically and practically important, as it has garnered considerable scientific and lay interest.},

The less motivated participants were to experience happiness, the less they tried to upregulate happiness in an emotion regulation task and downregulate negative emotions during real-life stress. Importantly, the less motivated depressed participants were to experience happiness, the more clinical symptoms they exhibited months later during a stressful period, even after controlling for initial levels of symptoms. These findings demonstrate that individual differences in the degree of motivation to experience happiness in depression may carry clinical implications.},

  abstract = {Abstract The Parkinson's disease (PD)-causative leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) belongs to the Roco family of G-proteins comprising a Ras-of-complex (Roc) domain followed by a C-terminal of Roc (COR) domain in tandem (called Roc-COR domain). Two prokaryotic Roc-COR domains have been characterized as ?G proteins activated by guanine nucleotide-dependent dimerization? (GADs), which require dimerization for activation of their GTPase activity and bind guanine nucleotides with relatively low affinities. Additionally, LRRK2 Roc domain in isolation binds guanine nucleotides with relatively low affinities. As such, LRRK2 GTPase domain was predicted to be a GAD. Herein, we describe the design and high-level expression of human LRRK2 Roc-COR domain (LRRK2 Roc-COR). Biochemical analyses of LRRK2 Roc-COR reveal that it forms homodimers, with the C-terminal portion of COR mediating its dimerization. Furthermore, it co-purifies and binds Mg2+GTP/GDP at 1~:~1 stoichiometry, and it hydrolyzes GTP with Km~and~kcat~of 22 nM and 4.70~?~10?4~min?1,~respectively. Thus, even though LRRK2 Roc-COR forms GAD-like homodimers, it exhibits conventional Ras-like GTPase properties, with high-affinity binding of Mg2+-GTP/GDP and low intrinsic catalytic activity. The PD-causative Y1699C mutation mapped to the COR domain was previously reported to reduce the GTPase activity of full-length LRRK2. In contrast, this mutation induces no change in the GTPase activity, and only slight perturbations in the secondary structure contents of LRRK2 Roc-COR. As this mutation does not directly affect the GTPase activity of the isolated Roc-COR tandem, it is possible that the effects of this mutation on full-length LRRK2 occur via other functional domains.

Our results show that synchronous visuo-tactile stimulation can indeed enhance facial mimicry and that this depends on participants' baseline tendency to mimic..

To adjudicate between these accounts, we draw on a unique, multisite, panel data set of whole networks, with information about many social relationships, attitudes, and demographics. This evidence permits a stronger foundation for inferences than more common egocentric methods. We find that incidental processes shape discussion networks much more powerfully than purposive ones.

  abstract = {We report a novel transposed-word effect in speeded grammaticality judgments made about five-word sequences. The critical ungrammatical test sequences were formed by transposing two adjacent words from either a grammatical base sequence (e.g., ``The white cat was big'' became ``The white was cat big'') or an ungrammatical base sequence (e.g., ``The white cat was slowly'' became ``The white was cat slowly''). These were intermixed with an equal number of correct sentences for the purpose of the grammaticality judgment task. In a laboratory experiment (N = 57) and an online experiment (N = 94), we found that ungrammatical decisions were harder to make when the ungrammatical sequence originated from a grammatically correct base sequence. This provides the first demonstration that the encoding of word order retains a certain amount of uncertainty. We further argue that the novel transposed-word effect reflects parallel processing of words during written sentence comprehension combined with top-down constraints from sentence-level structures.},

In two studies (N = 1202), we investigated the relation between this suggested continuum from Inequality Aversion (IA) to Joint Gain Maximization (JGM), the HEXACO personality dimensions, and SVO. To account for differences in fairness perception, we also considered whether inequality favored oneself or the other. As hypothesized, Honesty-Humility was the best basic trait predictor of IA, showing a slightly stronger positive link when inequality was self-advantageous. SVO, in turn, showed a stronger (negative) link when inequality was disadvantageous for the self. Overall, the results show that IA is related to (basic) personality traits in a theoretically meaningful way.},

Correspondingly, social mindfulness has been proposed to involve processes of executive functioning and thus of deliberate thinking. In four studies, we tested the influence of processing mode on social mindfulness using different experimental manipulations (i.e., instructions to decide intuitively vs. deliberately, time pressure, and cognitive load). Contrary to the idea that social mindfulness requires conscious processing \textendash{} and unlike recent findings suggesting intuitive cooperation \textendash{} we consistently found negligible effect sizes for the influence of processing mode on social mindfulness. This was observable for both, prosocial and selfish individuals alike (i.e., those with high vs. low levels in Social Value Orientation or Honesty-Humility, respectively). Overall, the findings suggest that social mindfulness constitutes a general tendency to perceive and act prosocially in social situations that is unaffected by processing mode and, by implication, distinguishable from other types of prosocial behavior.},

Because words such as spicy or hot tend to be associated with physical attractiveness, spicy flavor was examined in relation to embodied cognition. Similarly, words such as honey or sweetie tend to be associated with romantic relationships; therefore sweet taste was also examined in relation to embodied cognition. Eighty-seven women were given 1 of 3 snacks: a sweet, spicy, or a nonsweet/ nonspicy snack. As they consumed the snack, they were instructed to look at 3 male faces of high, moderate, and low attractiveness and respond to questions asking about the physical attractiveness and their romantic interest in the men. Two 1-way Analyses of Variance were performed separately on the dependent variables of physical attraction and romantic interest. A significant main effect was found for flavor on both dependent variables. Women in the spicy condition rated the men as significantly more attractive than those in the sweet condition, F(2, 84) = 3.59, p = .03, {$\eta$}p2 = .08. Additionally, the women in the spicy condition also rated their romantic interest in the men higher than those in the sweet condition F(2, 84) = 3.84, p = .03, {$\eta$}p2 = .08. This work extends the breadth and application of embodied cognition, specifically in regard to relationship and attractiveness research.},

Driven by the requirements of energy impact modellers, policymakers and building design experts; a new historical high-spatial resolution, global gridded dataset of degree-days constructed using various base (threshold) temperatures (Tb) is presented in this study. Derived using sub-daily temperature from a quality-controlled reanalysis data product (Global Land Data Assimilation System\textemdash GLDAS), the dataset called `DegDays\_0p25\_1970\_2018' includes monthly and annual (i) CDD; (ii) HDD; and (iii) CDD computed using wet-bulb temperature (CDDwb) at 0.25\textdegree{} \texttimes{} 0.25\textdegree{} gridded resolution, covering 49 years over the period 1970\textendash 2018.

DegDays\_0p25\_1970\_2018 fills gaps in existing energy indicators' datasets by being the only high-resolution historical global gridded time series based on multiple threshold temperatures, thus offering applications in wide-ranging climate zones and thermal comfort environments. The richness of DegDays\_0p25\_1970\_2018 lies in its flexibility by allowing users to aggregate the degree-days not only at varying spatial scales (such as administrative levels, national boundaries, economic organizations e.g. OECD; with or without population weights), but also at varying temporal scales (such as seasons), thereby offering climatologists with a potential to examine global teleconnection patterns more discretely.},

These conventions, furthermore, changed on a trial-by-trial basis in response to shared environmental and task constraints. Strikingly, as a result, signals of the same form successfully conveyed contradictory messages from trial to trial. Such behavior is evidence for the involvement of what we term joint inference, in which social interactants spontaneously infer the most sensible communicative convention in light of the common ground between them. Joint inference may help to elucidate how communicative conventions emerge instantaneously and how they are modified and reshaped into the elaborate systems of conventions involved in human communication, including natural languages.},

  abstract = {Background
Hoarding and obsessive-compulsive behaviours (OCB) are well documented symptoms in frontotemporal dementia (FTD). While contemporary models consider hoarding and obsessive-compulsive disorder distinct, the related behaviours have not been separately examined in patients with FTD, and the neuroanatomical correlates of hoarding in patients with FTD have not been previously examined (American Psychiatric Association, 2013; Grisham and Baldwin, 2015; Mataix-Cols et~al., 2010).
Methods
Patients with FTD who were evaluated between 2004 and 2018~at our centre were included. Cortical thickness and subcortical volumetric analyses were completed on available T1 high resolution anatomic scans using FreeSurfer.
Results
Eighty-seven patients met inclusion criteria, and 49 had scans available for quantitative MRI volumetric analysis. New hoarding behaviours were present in 29\% of patients and were more common in the semantic variant subtype of FTD, while 49\% of individuals had new or increased OCB. Hoarding behaviours were associated with decreased thickness in a factor comprised of left temporal, insular and anterior cingulate cortices. The presence of OCB was predicted by reduced cortical thickness and volumes in a factor comprised of the anterior cingulate and subcortical volumes in the bilateral amygdala and hippocampus. OCB were associated with greater right temporal cortical thickness in comparison to patients with hoarding.
Discussion
The association of the semantic variant with hoarding, together with the observed associations between left temporal atrophy and hoarding indicate that degeneration of the left temporal lobe has a role in the emergence of hoarding in FTD. As in current models of Hoarding disorder and Obsessive\textendash Compulsive disorder, our results suggest that in patients with FTD, hoarding and OCB are clinically and anatomically partially dissociable phenomenon. The results may also help to further elucidate the cognitive processes and neural networks contributing to Hoarding disorder and Obsessive\textendash Compulsive disorder in persons without dementia.},

The perceptual asymmetry theory predicted that stimuli in the lower visual field would be processed more fluently and would therefore be perceived as more familiar. The working memory theory, originally proposed in space\textendash number research, envisaged type-specific spatial patterns for different stimuli. Participants made old/new recognition memory judgements for stimuli, presented at random positions, while their eye movements were recorded. The observed spatial patterns changed according to the stimulus type (e.g., ``more left\,=\,older'' for horizontally written words and ``upper\,=\,older'' for vertically written words), and this flexibility is encapsulated by the working memory theory as follows: (a) stimulus-type-specific spatial configurations are encoded in long-term memory on the basis of one's experience (e.g., vertically written words are empirically associated with the ``upper\,=\,older'' spatial configuration), (b) the presentation of a stimulus automatically cues the temporal activation of the associated spatial configuration in working memory, and (c) the referential process between the stimulus and configuration unconsciously affects the viewer's sense of familiarity.},

Here, I found that salient distractors reduced rather than increased response times on target-absent trials (Experiment 1; N = 200). Combined with higher error rates on target-present trials, these results indicate that distractors can induce observers to quit search earlier than they otherwise would. These effects were replicated when target prevalence was low (Experiment 2; N = 200) and with different stimuli that elicited shallower search slopes (Experiment 3; N = 75). These results demonstrate that salient distractors can produce at least two consequences in visual search: They can capture attention, and they can cause observers to quit searching early. This novel finding has implications both for understanding visual attention and for examining distraction in real-world domains where targets are often absent, such as medical image screening.},

We tested these accounts by investigating whether anger and disgust vary depending on the costs imposed by moral violations and whether they differentially correspond with aggressive tendencies. Results across four studies favor a sociofunctional account: When the target of a moral violation shifts from the self to another person, anger decreases, but disgust increases. Whereas anger is associated with high-cost, direct aggression, disgust is associated with less costly indirect aggression. Finally, whether the target of a moral violation is the self or another person influences direct aggression partially via anger and influences indirect aggression partially via disgust.},

Our aim was to investigate the presence of subtle motor deficits in this population and its relationship with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid-{$\beta$} levels. We adapted the Finger Tapping Task to measure tapping speed and intrasubject variability. Seventy-two right-handed participants completed the study. Subjects were divided into three groups according to their CSF biomarker profile: 37 control participants (negative CSF AD biomarkers, CTR), 20 cognitively normal subjects with amyloid-{$\beta$} positivity (abnormal levels of CSF A{$\beta$}42, A{$\beta$}+) and 15 AD patients. All subjects underwent lumbar puncture for the CSF analysis, apolipoprotein E genotyping and completed the Finger Tapping Task, a neuropsychological battery and cardiovascular risk factor and physical activity assessments. An overall difference between groups was found both in tapping speed [F(2,66)~=~19.37, p~{$<~$}.01] and in intrasubject variability [F(2,66)~=~11.40, p~{$<~$}.01]. More specifically, the A{$\beta$}+ group showed lower speed [F(1,52)~=~5.33, p~{$<~$}.05] and greater intrasubject variability [F(1,52)~=~8.48, p~{$<~$}.01] than the CTR group, and higher speed than the AD group [F(1,30)~=~13.61, p~{$<~$}.01]. Speed ({$\beta~$}=~.263, p~{$<~$}.05) and intrasubject variability ({$\beta~$}=~-.558, p~{$<~$}.01) were significantly associated with CSF amyloid-{$\beta$} levels. The present findings suggest that subtle motor difficulties can be detected in cognitively healthy subjects with amyloid-{$\beta$} positivity and be related to CSF A{$\beta$}42 levels. An accurate assessment of motor functions could help on identifying individuals at the earliest stage of the Alzheimer's continuum.},

We found that the tendency to discount gains more than losses (i.e., the sign effect) emerged more strongly for future than for past outcomes. We present evidence from six studies (total N = 1,077) that the effect of tense on discounting is tied to differences in the contemplation emotion of these events, which we assessed by measuring participants' emotions while they either anticipated or remembered the event. We ruled out loss aversion, uncertainty, utility curvature, thought frequency, and connection to the future and past self as explanations for this phenomenon, and we discuss why people experience a distinct mixture of emotions when contemplating upcoming events.},

We used experimental norm manipulations (Studies 1\textendash 2, 4), cultural differences in tipping norms (Study 3), and behavioral economic games (Study 5). Across studies, people increased the magnitude of their moral judgments when an agent exceeded a descriptive norm and decreased the magnitude when an agent fell below a norm (Studies 1\textendash 4). Moreover, this differentiation was partially explained via perceptions of agents' desires (Studies 1\textendash 2); it emerged only when the agent was aware of the norm (Study 4); and it generalized to explain decisions of trust for real monetary stakes (Study 5). Together, these findings indicate that moral actions are evaluated in relation to what most other people do rather than solely in relation to morally objective rules.},

The first segment either matched (congruent condition) or did not match (incongruent condition) the first syllable. The SSVEP responses in the congruent condition showed increased power compared to the responses in the incongruent condition, providing new evidence that syllables are important sublexical units in visual word recognition and reading aloud. With respect to the neural correlates of the effect, syllables elicited an early activation of a right hemisphere network. This network is typically associated with the programming of complex motor sequences, cognitive control and timing. Subsequently, responses were obtained in left hemisphere areas related to phonological processing.},

Typical examples include controlling for posttreatment variables in statistical models, eliminating observations based on posttreatment criteria, or subsetting the data based on posttreatment variables. Though these modeling choices are intended to address common problems encountered when conducting experiments, they can bias estimates of causal effects. Moreover, problems associated with conditioning on posttreatment variables remain largely unrecognized in the field, which we show frequently publishes experimental studies using these practices in our discipline's most prestigious journals. We demonstrate the severity of experimental posttreatment bias analytically and document the magnitude of the potential distortions it induces using visualizations and reanalyses of real-world data.

In this article, we introduce a family of tree-based nonparametric techniques that may, in some circumstances, be more appropriate than traditional methods for confronting these data challenges. In particular, tree models are very effective for detecting nonlinearities and interactions, even in data sets with many (potentially irrelevant) covariates. We introduce the basic logic of tree-based models, provide an overview of the most prominent methods in the literature, and conduct three analyses that illustrate how the methods can be implemented while highlighting both their advantages and limitations.},

These effects operate over and above targets' belief in moralizing gods and offer a novel theoretical perspective on religion and trust.},

Across three experiments, we found no convincing evidence for a scene-congruency effect or a modulation of scene congruency by scene inversion. These findings question the generalizability of previous observations and cast doubt on whether genuine semantic processing of object-background relationships in scenes can manifest during interocular suppression.},

We apply the ``constrained choice conditional logistic regression'' to survey data from the 1989 parliamentary election in Norway to examine the effects of party identification of voters and electoral viability and policy extremity of parties on individual voters' choice set compositions. Further, we look into the effect of parties' policy positions on their electoral fates under alternative assumptions about the composition of voters' choice sets. We find that voters' choice set composition conditions both the effects of their policy considerations on vote choice and those of parties' policy offerings on their electoral fates.},

  abstract = {Abstract Adenosine A2A receptors (A2AR) play a key role in modulating dopamine-dependent locomotor activity, as heralded by the sensitization of locomotor activity upon chronic A2AR blockade, which is associated with elevated dopamine levels and altered corticostriatal synaptic plasticity. Since the orphan receptor GPR37 has been shown to modulate A2AR function in~vivo, we aimed to test whether the A2AR-mediated sensitization of locomotor activity is GPR37-dependent and involves adaptations of synaptic plasticity. To this end, we administered a selective A2AR antagonist, SCH58261 (1~mg/kg, i.p.), daily for 14~days, and the locomotor sensitization, striatum-dependent cued learning, and corticostriatal synaptic plasticity (i.e., long-term depression) were compared in wild-type and GPR37?/? mice. Notably, GPR37 deletion promoted A2AR-associated locomotor sensitization but not striatum-dependent cued learning revealed upon chronic SCH58261 treatment of mice. Furthermore, chronic A2AR blockade potentiated striatal long-term depression in corticostriatal synapses of GPR37?/? but not of wild-type mice, thus correlating well with neurochemical alterations of the adenosinergic system. Overall, these results revealed the importance of GPR37 regulating A2AR-dependent locomotor sensitization and synaptic plasticity in the basal ganglia circuitry.

Our results are consistent with findings from the specific paradigm that we replicated in that no effects on comprehension were detected in analyses conducted over all sites. However, further investigation is warranted due to site-specific effects and methodological limitations. We found all aspects of the multisite registered replication approach to be useful although the registration component itself appeared to be an especially feasible and valuable first step toward increasing the robustness and generalizability of findings in our field.

Moreover, previous functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) studies have reported altered dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) activity in anxious cohorts, particularly when executive control is required. Recently, it has been demonstrated that cortical glutamate levels can predict both functional activation during cognitive control, and anxiety levels. In the present study we sought to investigate the relationship between trait anxiety, prefrontal glutamate levels and functional activation in DLPFC during a cognitive control task. Thirty-nine participants assigned to either low trait anxiety (LTA) or high trait anxiety (HTA) groups underwent 1H-Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (1H-MRS) to measure levels of resting glutamate in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Participants also completed fMRI during a Stroop task comprising congruent and incongruent colour word trials. The HTA group showed reduced task performance relative to the LTA group. In the LTA group, there was a positive association between PFC Glu levels and DLPFC activation during incongruent trials. This association was absent in the HTA group. Individual differences in trait anxiety affect the relationship between PFC glutamate levels and DLPFC activation, possibly contributing to ineffective task performance when cognitive control is required.},

  abstract = {Transcription, translation, and turnover of transcripts and proteins are essential for cellular function. The contribution of those factors to protein levels is under debate, as transcript levels and cognate protein levels do not necessarily correlate due to regulation of translation and protein turnover. Here we propose neuronal polarity as a third factor that is particularly evident in the CNS, leading to considerable distances between somata and axon terminals. Consequently, transcript levels may negatively correlate with cognate protein levels in CNS regions, i.e., transcript and protein levels behave reciprocally. To test this hypothesis, we performed an integrative inter-omics study and analyzed three interconnected rat auditory brainstem regions (cochlear nuclear complex, CN; superior olivary complex, SOC; inferior colliculus, IC) and the rest of the brain as a reference. We obtained transcript and protein sets in these regions of interest (ROIs) by DNA microarrays and label-free mass spectrometry, and performed principal component and correlation analyses. We found 508 transcript|protein pairs and detected poor to moderate transcript|protein correlation in all ROIs, as evidenced by coefficients of determination from 0.34 to 0.54. We identified 57-80 negatively correlating gene products in the ROIs and intensively analyzed four of them for which the correlation was poorest. Three cognate proteins (Slc6a11, Syngr1, Tppp) were synaptic and hence candidates for a negative correlation because of protein transport into axon terminals. Thus, we systematically analyzed the negatively correlating gene products. Gene ontology analyses revealed overrepresented transport/synapse-related proteins, supporting our hypothesis. We present 30 synapse/transport-related proteins with poor transcript|protein correlation. In conclusion, our analyses support that protein transport in polar cells is a third factor that influences the protein level and, thereby, the transcript|protein correlation.

  abstract = {Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) non-invasively induces polarity-dependent excitability alterations in the human motor cortex lasting for more than an hour after stimulation. Clinical applications with encouraging results have been reported in several pilot studies, but the optimal stimulation protocols remain to be determined. This is also important because the efficacy and directionality of tDCS effects follow non-linear rules regarding neuroplastic effects for the stimulation parameters duration and intensity. In this study, we systemically explored the association between tDCS, these parameters and induced after-effects on motor cortex excitability. Cathodal tDCS was applied in four different intensities (sham, 1, 2 and 3~mA) and three durations (15, 20 and 30~mins) in 16 young healthy subjects and the after-effects were monitored with TMS-induced motor evoked potentials (MEP) until the next day evening after stimulation. The results of the repeated measures ANOVA conducted to disentangle the effects of tDCS intensity and duration show a main effect of intensity in which 1~mA and 3~mA stimulation induced a reduction of MEP amplitudes, but 2~mA resulted in excitability enhancement. The results of a secondary ANOVA conducted to compare if active stimulation effects differ from those of sham stimulation revealed a significant main effect of tDCS condition in which 1~mA\textendash 15~min, 1~mA\textendash 30~min and 3~mA\textendash 20~min cathodal tDCS induced LTD-like plasticity, while LTP-like plasticity was observed after 2~mA\textendash 20~min stimulation. Our study thus provides further insights on the dependency of tDCS -induced neuroplasticity from the stimulation parameters, and therefore delivers crucial information for future applications.},

  abstract = {Abstract X11/Mint 1 and X11-like (X11L)/Mint 2 are neuronal adaptor protein to regulate trafficking and/or localization of various membrane proteins. By analyzing the localization of neuronal membrane proteins in X11-, X11L-, and X11/X11L doubly deficient mice with membrane fractionation procedures, we found that deficient of X11 and X11L decreased the level of glutamate receptors in non-PSD fraction. This finding suggests that X11 and X11L regulate the glutamate receptor micro-localization to the extrasynaptic region. In vitro coimmunoprecipitation studies of NMDA receptors lacking various cytoplasmic regions with X11 and X11L proteins harboring domain deletion suggest that extrasynaptic localization of NMDA receptor may be as a result of the multiple interactions of the receptor subunits with X11 and X11L regulated by protein phosphorylation, while that of {$\alpha$}-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor subunits is not dependent on the binding with X11 and X11L proteins. Because the loss of X11 and X11L tends to impair the exocytosis, but not endocytosis, of glutamate receptors, NMDA receptors are likely to be supplied to the extrasynaptic plasma membrane with a way distinct from the mechanism regulating the localization of NMDA receptors into synaptic membrane region. Reduced localization of NMDA receptor into the extrasynaptic region increased slightly the phosphorylation level of cAMP responsible element binding protein in brain of X11/X11L doubly deficient mice compare to wild-type mice, suggesting a possible role of X11 and X11L in the regulation of signal transduction pathway through extrasynaptic glutamate receptors.

  abstract = {Abstract Do individual differences in personality traits become more or less pronounced over childhood and adolescence? The present research examined age differences in the variance of a range of personality traits, using parent reports of two large samples of children from predominantly the USA and Russia, respectively. Results indicate (i) that individual differences in most traits tend to increase with age from early childhood into early adolescence and then plateau, (ii) that this general pattern of greater personality variance at older childhood age is consistent across the two countries, and (iii) that this pattern is not an artefact of age differences in means or floor/ceiling effects. These findings are consistent with several (noncontradictory) developmental mechanisms, including youths' expanding behavioural capacities and person?environment transactions (corresponsive principle). However, these mechanisms may predominantly characterize periods before adolescence, or they may be offset by countervailing processes, such as socialization pressure towards a mature personality profile, in late adolescence and adulthood. Finally, the findings also suggest that interpreting age trajectories in mean trait scores as pertaining to age differences in a typical person may sometimes be misleading. Investigating variance should become an integral part of studying personality development. Copyright ? 2017 European Association of Personality Psychology},

Numerous campaigns have been created to convince people to adopt environmentally friendly everyday behaviors, with varying success. The difficulty may be due, at least in part, to the huge gap between these small individual actions and the high-level goals, such as ``saving the planet,'' often used as incentives. We tested this hypothesis via four experiments. Studies 1 and 2 showed that high-level goals were less effective than low-level goals in promoting paper- and energy-saving behaviors. Study 3 showed that high-level goals engender lower perceived outcome expectancy and higher perception of cumulative effort. Study 4 showed that outcome expectancy mediates the direct effect of goal level on intention.},

Three experiments reported here (N = 235) demonstrated the reversed causal direction: Voluntary visual attention intensifies perceived emotion. In Experiment 1, participants repeatedly directed attention toward a target object during sequential search. Participants subsequently perceived their emotional reactions to target objects as more intense than their reactions to control objects. Experiments 2 and 3 used a spatial-cuing procedure to manipulate voluntary visual attention. Spatially cued attention increased perceived emotional intensity. Participants perceived spatially cued objects as more emotionally intense than noncued objects even when participants were asked to mentally rehearse the name of noncued objects. This suggests that the intensifying effect of attention is independent of more extensive mental rehearsal. Across experiments, attended objects were perceived as more visually distinctive, which statistically mediated the effects of attention on emotional intensity.},

Many                     researchers have suggested that laptop note taking is less effective than                     longhand note taking for learning. Prior studies have primarily focused on                     students' capacity for multitasking and distraction when using laptops. The                     present research suggests that even when laptops are used solely to take notes,                     they may still be impairing learning because their use results in shallower                     processing.

These preferences serve to maximise fitness of future offspring. But this model neglects the role of social norms in shaping evolved mating strategies. For example, in conservative cultures, individuals are likely to face costs such as punishment for short-term mating. Here we show that conservatives over-perceive some mates' suitability as long-term partners. Study 1 found that conservatives were less likely to use a short-term strategy that was distinctive from their long-term strategy. Study 2 showed that conservatives over-perceived hypothetical mates as long-term investing partners, despite their lack of commitment-compatible traits. Conservatism was measured at the regional- (India, USA, UK) and individual-level. Our results demonstrate how social norms may bias behaviour. We anticipate our findings to be a starting point for more sophisticated models, drawing on developments from evolutionary and social psychology.},

Nine raters expert with the AMPD and personality evaluated elements of Criterion A and the 25 trait facets of Criterion B for presence of type and degree of personality constructs and paradigms, as well as level of inference. Criterion B showed higher rater agreement compared to Criterion A. Criteria A and B reflect different configurations of construct, paradigm, and level of inference.

By applying general growth mixture modelling to data from the representative German pairfam study (N?=?12?377), four latent classes of self?esteem development across five years were extracted. Based on their mean levels, trajectories, and variability, individuals in the latent classes could be described as having (a) constant and stable high self?esteem (29.00\% of the sample), (b) constant but variable moderate self?esteem (31.69\%), (c) increasing and stabilizing self?esteem (15.13\%), and (d) decreasing and variable self?esteem (24.18\%). Furthermore, these latent classes differed in accordance with findings of prior research on self?rated, partner?rated, and objective correlates of the domains of health and well?being, partner relationships, and occupational status. Thus, the current study shows that inter?individual variation in intra?individual change in self?esteem is not random but reflects specific individual trajectories, or pathways, of self?esteem.

  abstract = {AbstractMaternal transfer of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) confronts developing embryos with a pollution legacy and poses conservation concerns due to its potential impacts unto subsequent generations. We conducted a systematic review focusing on: 1) processes of POP maternal transfer, 2) challenges and opportunities to synthesizing current knowledge on POP concentrations in eggs, and 3) a meta-analysis of patterns in current egg pollution data. Results suggest selective maternal transfer of individual compounds. These relate to biological factors such as the foraging and remigration behavior, and to the selective mobilization of POPs during vitellogenesis, such as increased diffusion limitation for lipophilic POPs and slower release and higher reabsorption of apolar POPs. A key gap relates to knowledge of further selective toxicokinetics during embryonic development, as research to date has mainly focused on initial uptake into eggs. Challenges in the synthesis of current data on egg contamination profiles relate to methodological differences, varying analytical approaches, restricted data access, and reporting transparency among studies. To increase opportunities in the use of current data, we propose best practice guidelines, and synthesize a database on POP concentrations within sea turtle eggs. The meta-analysis revealed a geographical and taxonomic bias on the West Atlantic Ocean, including the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea, with most studies conducted on green turtles. Concentrations of POPs show temporal patterns related to trends in usage, production, release, and persistence in the environment, often with regional patterns. The trophic level has the potential to influence POP patterns with higher concentrations in loggerheads compared to other species, but this is confounded by temporal and geographic trends. We argue for more mechanistically process-focused and methodologically comparable research. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;39:9\textendash 29. \textcopyright{} 2019 SETAC},

  abstract = {Regulation of neurotransmitter release in the central nervous system is complex. Here, we investigated regulatory mechanisms for acetylcholine (ACh) release from cholinergic neurons by performing superfusion experiments with rat striatal segments after labelling the cellular ACh pool with [3H]choline. Electrical stimulation-evoked pronounced [3H]ACh release from cholinergic neurons. The estimated quantity of [3H]ACh release per pulse of electrical stimulation was reduced by an increase in stimulus frequency, showing an inverse correlation between release probability of ACh and neuronal excitation. ACh release was also negatively regulated by pre-synaptic muscarinic ACh receptors (mAChRs). The autoinhibition induced by released ACh was predominantly suppressed by the M2-selective antagonist AF-DX 116, partially inhibited by M3-selective darifenacin, and minimally by M4-selective PD 102807. Other subtype-selective antagonists had no effect at subtype-selective concentrations. ACh esterase (AChE) inhibitors (diisopropylfluorophosphate, donepezil and galantamine) at concentrations that mostly inhibit esterase activity reduced [3H]ACh release, and the reduction was abolished by treatment with atropine. This implies that pre-synaptic autoreceptors are activated more after blockade of ACh hydrolysis, leading to autoinhibition of ACh release and consequent reduction in synaptic ACh concentrations. [3H]efflux was also enhanced by ACh uptake inhibitors (100 {$\mu$}M hemicholinium-3 and physostigmine), regardless of ACh hydrolysis. This study shows that synaptic ACh concentrations in striatal cholinergic neurons are regulated in a complex manner by many factors such as release probability, pre-synaptic M2/M3/M4 mAChRs, AChE and post-synaptic ACh uptake, and provides important information about cholinergic neurotransmission for future exploration of therapeutic strategies for Alzheimer's and other central nervous system diseases.

Almost half of the sample reported a false memory for at least one fabricated event, with more than one third of participants reporting a specific memory of the event. ``Yes'' voters (those in favor of legalizing abortion) were more likely than ``no'' voters to ``remember'' a fabricated scandal regarding the campaign to vote ``no,'' and ``no'' voters were more likely than ``yes'' voters to ``remember'' a fabricated scandal regarding the campaign to vote ``yes.'' This difference was particularly strong for voters of low cognitive ability. A subsequent warning about possible misinformation slightly reduced rates of false memories but did not eliminate these effects. This study suggests that voters in a real-world political campaign are most susceptible to forming false memories for fake news that aligns with their beliefs, in particular if they have low cognitive ability.},

Under this model, a distinction is made between beliefs regarding the degree to which interoceptive signals are the object of attention and beliefs regarding one's ability to perceive accurately interoceptive signals. This distinction is difficult to test, however, because of the paucity of measures designed to assess self-reported perception of one's own interoceptive accuracy. This article therefore reports on the development of such a measure, the Interoceptive Accuracy Scale (IAS). Use of this measure enables assessment of the proposed distinction between beliefs regarding attention to, and accuracy in perceiving, interoceptive signals. Across six studies, we report on the development of the IAS and, importantly, its relationship with measures of trait self-reported interoceptive attention, objective interoceptive accuracy, confidence in the accuracy of specific interoceptive percepts, and metacognition with respect to interoceptive accuracy. Results support the distinction between individual differences in perceived attention towards interoceptive information and the accuracy of interoceptive perception.},

Critically, previous studies have included either verbal or gesture production in the training. However, while in speakers without language impairment, action naming is facilitated by gesture observation, no study has yet systematically determined whether gesture observation alone influences word retrieval in people with aphasia. This is the aim of the research presented here. In a gesture priming experiment, participants with aphasia named actions that were preceded by the observation of videos of congruent or unrelated gestures or a non-gesture control condition. At the group-level, action naming was facilitated by observation of congruent gestures. However, single-case analyses revealed variability in the extent to which the participants benefited from gesture cueing. The potential mechanisms underlying the effects of gesture observation on action picture naming in people with aphasia were examined by exploring participant-related and item-related predictors of improvement. It is concluded that gesture observation may facilitate verb retrieval at either semantic or lexical levels. In addition, and despite variability across individuals, gesture observation seems more likely to facilitate action naming in people with spared gesture semantics and mild-moderate deficits in lexical-semantic or post-semantic processing.},

Effects of spatial compatibility are usually explained by a match or mismatch of automatic behavioural tendencies and intentional mapping processes. The question is whether actors develop such behavioural tendencies for an avatar and thereby are able to neglect their own perspective. In the experiments, actors take the perspective of the avatar and pressed ipsilateral or contralateral left\textendash right keys in response to lateralised coloured discs. Experiments 1 and 2 showed that compatibility effects are tied to the avatar but not to the actor. Experiment 3 revealed that participants could ignore the perspective of the avatar.

It is likely that the present results are not only applicable to the use of avatars but also to other human-controlled robots and drones.},

  abstract = {Abstract The close association of myelinated axons and their myelin sheaths involves numerous intercellular molecular interactions. For example, myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) mediates myelin-to-axon adhesion and signalling via molecules on the axonal surface. However, knowledge about intracellular binding partners of myelin proteins, including MAG, has remained limited. The two splice isoforms of MAG, S- and L-MAG, display distinct cytoplasmic domains and spatiotemporal expression profiles. We used yeast two-hybrid screening to identify interaction partners of L-MAG and found the dynein light chain DYNLL1 (also termed dynein light chain 8). DYNLL1 homodimers are known to facilitate dimerization of target proteins. L-MAG and DYNLL1 associate with high affinity, as confirmed with recombinant proteins in~vitro. Structural analyses of the purified complex indicate that the DYNLL1-binding segment is localized close to the L-MAG C terminus, next to the Fyn kinase Tyr phosphorylation site. The crystal structure of the complex between DYNLL1 and its binding segment on L-MAG shows 2~:~2 binding in a parallel arrangement, indicating a heterotetrameric complex. The homology between L-MAG and previously characterized DYNLL1-ligands is limited, and some details of binding site interactions are unique for L-MAG. The structure of the complex between the entire L-MAG cytoplasmic domain and DYNLL1, as well as that of the extracellular domain of MAG, were modelled based on small-angle X-ray scattering data, allowing structural insights into L-MAG interactions on both membrane surfaces. Our data imply that DYNLL1 dimerizes L-MAG, but not S-MAG, through the formation of a specific 2~:~2 heterotetramer. This arrangement is likely to affect, in an isoform-specific manner, the functions of MAG in adhesion and myelin-to-axon signalling.

Perceived competence was a far better predictor of the outcomes of real elections held in the United States than of elections held in Korea. When deciding which of two candidates to vote for in hypothetical elections, however, Koreans and Americans both voted on the basis of perceived competence inferred from facial appearance. Combining actual and hypothetical election results, we conclude that for Koreans, competence judgments from face-to-trait inferences are critical in voting only when other information is unavailable. However, in the United States, such competence judgments are substantially important, even in the presence of other information.},

For instance, respondents with more coursework tended to accord more value to pronunciation instruction, to set more pronunciation-related goals for language instruction, and to reject delaying a focus on pronunciation.

  abstract = {How likely are third parties to intervene in repeated conflicts between adversaries? Can third party intervention redirect competitive interactions toward collectively beneficial cooperation? Does mutual cooperation persist when the third party can no longer intervene in the conflict? To address these theoretically and practically important questions, we introduce the Repeated Peacemaker Game. Adversaries and third parties interacted for 60 game rounds in our incentivized experiment, producing a rich dataset of 7200 decisions. Participants made decisions under one of two conditions: In the Early Intervention condition, third party intervention was initially possible and then became impossible. In the Late Intervention condition, third party intervention was initially impossible and then became possible. Third parties in the Early Intervention condition intervened at high rates and established cooperative norms that outlasted the intervention period, resulting in sustainable cooperation even after intervention was no longer possible. By comparison, third parties in the Late Intervention condition intervened at relatively lower rates, but still effectively promoted cooperation, despite the initial history of competition between adversaries. We find strong evidence for `conditional cooperation', whereby adversaries and third parties reciprocate each other's choices in preceding rounds: Adversaries were more likely to cooperate when third parties intervened in the preceding round; third parties, in turn, were more likely to intervene when one or both adversaries cooperated in the preceding round than if both adversaries competed in the preceding round. These findings help explain when, why, and how third parties promote cooperation in groups.},

This study examined the effects of semantic clustering while addressing the limitations of previous studies (e.g., confounding of semantic relatedness with other lexical variables). Furthermore, the study investigated the effects of spacing because spacing might facilitate the learning of semantically related items by alleviating interference. In this study, 133 Japanese university students studied 48 English-Japanese word pairs under two conditions: massed and spaced. Half the words were semantically related to each other while the other half were not. Although there were no significant differences between semantically related and unrelated items in posttest scores, semantically related items led to more interference errors than unrelated items. Furthermore, contrary to the authors' hypothesis that spacing is particularly beneficial for semantically related items, spacing benefited unrelated items more than it did related items.},

  abstract = {Cognitive psychology research has shown that interleaving, wherein learners practice multiple skills or concepts at once, facilitates learning more than does blocking, wherein learners practice only one skill or concept at a time. Despite the advantage of interleaving over blocking observed across a number of domains, limited attention has been devoted to the effects of interleaving on second language (L2) learning. This study examined the effects of blocking and interleaving on L2 grammar learning. In this study, 115 Japanese learners studied 5 English grammatical structures under 1 of 3 conditions: blocking, interleaving, and increasing (i.e., blocking followed by interleaving). Learning was measured using a grammaticality judgment test administered immediately and 1 week after the treatment. Although interleaving led to the highest number of incorrect responses during training, it was more effective than blocking in the 1-week delayed posttest. These results indicate that the advantage of interleaving extends to L2 grammar learning. Furthermore, learners' levels of prior knowledge were found to moderate the effects of interleaving. Specifically, participants with lower pretest scores benefited more from interleaving compared to those with higher pretest scores. Pedagogically, the findings suggest that grammar learning may be enhanced by incorporating interleaved practice.},

In recent years, increased attention has been given to understanding the dynamical principles that underlie such coordination because of a growing interest in behavioral synchrony and complex-systems phenomena. Here, we examined the behavioral dynamics of a novel, multiagent shepherding task, in which pairs of individuals had to corral small herds of virtual sheep in the center of a virtual game field. Initially, all pairs adopted a complementary, search-and-recover mode of behavioral coordination, in which both members corralled sheep predominantly on their own sides of the field. Over the course of game play, however, a significant number of pairs spontaneously discovered a more effective mode of behavior: coupled oscillatory containment, in which both members synchronously oscillated around the sheep. Analysis and modeling revealed that both modes were defined by the task's underlying dynamics and, moreover, reflected context-specific realizations of the lawful dynamics that define functional shepherding behavior more generally.},

Greater decentering attenuated the associations of negative affect with dysphoria and panic symptoms, in both cross-sectional (Study 1) and ecological momentary assessment (Study 2) designs.

We conducted a preregistered study of the relationship between brain volume and cognitive performance using a new sample of adults from the United Kingdom that is about 70\% larger than the combined samples of all previous investigations on this subject (N = 13,608). Our analyses systematically controlled for sex, age, height, socioeconomic status, and population structure, and our analyses were free of publication bias. We found a robust association between total brain volume and fluid intelligence (r = .19), which is consistent with previous findings in the literature after controlling for measurement quality of intelligence in our data. We also found a positive relationship between total brain volume and educational attainment (r = .12). These relationships were mainly driven by gray matter (rather than white matter or fluid volume), and effect sizes were similar for both sexes and across age groups.},

In the largest study of behavioral effects of testosterone administration to date, 243 men received either testosterone or placebo and took the Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT), which estimates the capacity to override incorrect intuitive judgments with deliberate correct responses. Testosterone administration reduced CRT scores. The effect remained after we controlled for age, mood, math skills, whether participants believed they had received the placebo or testosterone, and the effects of 14 additional hormones, and it held for each of the CRT questions in isolation. Our findings suggest a mechanism underlying testosterone's diverse effects on humans' judgments and decision making and provide novel, clear, and testable predictions.},

The Case of Self-compassion and Neuroticism' that argues the negative items of the Self-compassion Scale (SCS), which represent reduced uncompassionate self-responding, are redundant with neuroticism (especially its depression and anxiety facets) and do not evidence incremental validity in predicting life satisfaction. Using potentially problematic methods to examine the factor structure of the SCS (higher-order confirmatory factor analysis), they suggest a total self-compassion score should not be used and negative items should be dropped. In Study 1, we present a reanalysis of their data using what we argue are more theoretically appropriate methods (bifactor exploratory structural equation modelling) that support use of a global self-compassion factor (explaining 94\% of item variance) over separate factors representing compassionate and reduced uncompassionate self-responding. While self-compassion evidenced a large correlation with neuroticism and depression and a small correlation with anxiety, it explained meaningful incremental validity in life satisfaction compared with neuroticism, depression, and anxiety. Findings were replicated in Study 2, which examined emotion regulation. Study 3 established the incremental validity of negative items with multiple well-being outcomes.

This coherence allows for the reconstruction of different aspects of an experience when triggered by a cue related to a past event\textemdash a process of pattern completion. Previous work has shown that such holistic recollection is evident in young adults, as revealed by dependency in retrieval success for various associations from the same event. In addition, episodic memory shows clear quantitative increases during early childhood. However, the ontogeny of holistic recollection is uncharted. Using dependency analyses, we found here that 4-year-olds (n = 32), 6-year-olds (n = 30), and young adults (n = 31) all retrieved complex events in a holistic manner; specifically, retrieval accuracy for one aspect of an event predicted accuracy for other aspects of the same event. However, the degree of holistic retrieval increased from the age 4 to adulthood. Thus, extended refinement of multiway binding may be one aspect of episodic memory development.},

I argue that the leaders of patriarchal social movements face pragmatic incentives to expand women's authority roles when seeking new movement members. Women authorities help patriarchal movements by making persuasive, identity-based arguments in favor of patriarchy that men cannot, and by reaching new audiences that men cannot. I support this argument by examining the rise of online female preachers in the Islamist Salafi movement, using interviews, Twitter analysis, and automated text analysis of 21,000 texts by 172 men and 43 women on the Salafi-oriented website saaid.net. To show the theory's generality, I also apply it to the contemporary white nationalist movement in the United States. The findings illustrate how movements that aggressively enforce traditional gender roles for participants can nevertheless increase female authority for pragmatic political reasons.},

Across two experiments, children waited longer for two marshmallows when they believed that their in-group waited and their out-group did not, compared with children who believed that their in-group did not wait and their out-group did. Group behavior influenced children to wait more, not less, as indicated by comparisons with children in a control condition who were assigned to a group but received no information about either groups' delay behavior (Experiment 1). Children also subsequently valued delaying gratification more if their in-group waited and their out-group did not (Experiment 2). Childhood self-control behavior and related developmental outcomes may be shaped by group norms around selfcontrol, which may be an optimal target for interventions.},

The decoy effect is the phenomenon that an additional but worse option can boost the appeal of an existing option. It has been widely demonstrated in hypothetical choices, but its usefulness in real-world settings has been subject to debate. In three longitudinal experiments in food-processing factories, we tested two decoy sanitation options that were worse than the existing sanitizer spray bottle. Results showed that the presence of a decoy, but not an additional copy of the original sanitizer bottle in a different color, drastically increased food workers' hand sanitizer use from the original sanitizer bottle and, consequently, improved workers' passing rate in hand sanitation tests from 60\% to 70\% to above 90\% for 20 days. These findings indicate that the decoy effect can be a powerful nudge technique to influence realworld behavior.},

  abstract = {Neural evidence suggests that mechanisms associated with conscious access (i.e., the ability to report on a conscious state) are ``all-or-none''. Upon crossing some threshold, neural signals are globally broadcast throughout the brain and allow conscious reports. However, whether subjective experience (phenomenal consciousness) is categorical (i.e., transitioning abruptly from unconscious to conscious states) or graded (i.e., characterized by multiple intermediate states) remains an open question. To address this issue, we built a series of artificial neural networks containing distinct feedback connectivity from ``multisensory'' to ``unisensory'' cortices. In line with consciousness theories, we operationalized perceptual consciousness by the presence of feedback from higher-order nodes back to unisensory nodes which allow `neural ignition' \textendash{} a rapid, non-linear boost in response putatively leading to phenomenal consciousness. When simulating how these networks responded to unisensory and multisensory inputs, we found the fastest responses for multisensory presentations associated with multisensory feedback, and the slowest responses for multisensory presentations without feedback. Most interestingly, despite being built in line with ``all-or-none'' models of consciousness, multisensory stimuli associated with unisensory feedback (i.e., auditory or visual), and hence consistent with unisensory phenomenology according to theories of consciousness, generated intermediate reaction times. To extend these models to human perception and performance, we conducted extensive psychophysical testing in 29 subjects who each completed 10~h of a multisensory cue-congruency task. Consistent with the modeling results, we found that reaction times to multisensory cues reported as unisensory were intermediate between those of fully aware and fully unaware cues. These results support the existence of graded forms of phenomenological consciousness that can be instantiated by simple neural networks built in line with ``all-or-none'' models of consciousness.},

However, such work has almost exclusively investigated these questions in young adults. During the same period, much has been learned about adult personality trait development but with scant attention to the momentary processes that contribute to development. The current work connects these two topics, testing developmental questions about adult age differences and thus examining how age matters to personality processes. The study examines how four important situation characteristics are experienced in everyday life and how situations covary with Big Five trait-relevant behaviour (i.e. situation\textendash behaviour contingencies). Two samples were collected (total N = 316), each assessing three age groups: young, middle-aged, and older adults. Using experience sampling method, participants completed reports four or five times per day across a representative period of daily life. Results suggested age differences in how situations are experienced on average, in the variability around these average situation experiences, and in situation\textendash behaviour contingencies. The results therefore highlight that, across adulthood, age groups experience chronically different situations, differ in how much the situations they experience vary moment to moment, and differ in how much situation experience predicts their enactment of traits. \textcopyright{} 2019 European Association of Personality Psychology},

Although increased emotion differentiation has been associated with positive mental health outcomes, little is known about its development. Participants (N = 143) between the ages of 5 and 25 years completed a laboratory measure of negative emotion differentiation in which they rated how much a series of aversive images made them feel angry, disgusted, sad, scared, and upset. Emotion-differentiation scores were computed using intraclass correlations. Emotion differentiation followed a nonlinear developmental trajectory: It fell from childhood to adolescence and rose from adolescence to adulthood. Mediation analyses suggested that an increased tendency to report feeling emotions one at a time explained elevated emotion differentiation in childhood. Importantly, two other mediators (intensity of emotional experiences and scale use) did not explain this developmental trend. Hence, low emotion differentiation in adolescence may arise because adolescents have little experience conceptualizing co-occurring emotions.},

We employed a dual-target neurostimulation approach in 30 healthy participants, using cortico-cortical paired associative stimulation (ccPAS) to target two key nodes: lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) and intraparietal sulcus (IPS), to test whether decision-making can be artificially shifted from habitual toward goal-directed control. Participants received three active stimulations, delivered at least six days apart (each involving 100 paired pulses over the IPS and LPFC, varying the interstimulus interval): two interventional, time-relevant ccPAS (10~msec interval) and one control, non-time-relevant ccPAS (100~msec interval). Following stimulation, participants completed a sequential learning task, measuring goal-directed/habitual control, and a working memory task. IPS\textrightarrow LPFC ccPAS (stimulating IPS, then LPFC with a 10~msec interval) shifted decision-making from habitual toward goal-directed control, compared to control ccPAS. There was no effect of LPFC\textrightarrow IPS ccPAS, nor an effect of any PAS condition on working memory. Previous studies have shown ccPAS effects outside the motor domain targeting prefrontal regions on response inhibition, attentional bias, and alpha asymmetry. The present study measures the behavioural effects of parietal-prefrontal PAS, focusing on a highly complex decision-making task and working memory. If confirmed in larger studies, this would be the first instance of neurostimulation successfully shifting decision-making from habitual to goal-directed control, putatively via inducing long-term potentiation between the IPS and LPFC. However, we found no effect in the other direction (LPFC\textrightarrow IPS ccPAS), and no effect on working memory overall. PAS is a relatively new neuromodulatory technique in the cognitive arsenal, and this study could help guide future approaches in healthy and disordered decision-making.},

  abstract = {Frequentist methods have long dominated data analysis in quantitative second language (L2) research. Recently, however, several empirical fields have begun to embrace alternatives known as Bayesian methods. Using an open-source approach, we provide an applied, nontechnical rationale for Bayesian methods in L2 research. First, we compare the conceptual underpinning of Bayesian and frequentist methods. Second, using real as well as carefully simulated examples, we introduce and apply Bayesian methods to various research designs. Third, to promote the use of Bayesian methods in L2 research, we introduce a free Web-accessed point-and-click software package (https://rnorouzian.shinyapps.io/bayesian-t-tests) as well as a suite of flexible R functions developed by the first author. Additionally, we demonstrate Bayesian methods for conducting secondary analysis on previously published literature. Finally, we discuss practical and theoretical dimensions of a Bayesian revolution in L2 research. Open Practices This article has been awarded Open Materials and Open Data badges.

  abstract = {Null hypothesis testing has long since been the `go-to analytic approach' in quantitative second language (L2) research (Norris, 2015, p. 97). To many, however, years of reliance on this approach has resulted in a crisis of inference across the social and behavioral sciences (e.g., Rouder et al., 2016). As an alternative to the null hypothesis testing approach, many such experts recommend the Bayesian hypothesis testing approach. Adopting an open-science framework, the present study (a) re-evaluates the empirical findings of 418 t-tests from published L2 research using Bayesian hypothesis testing, and (b) compares the Bayesian results with their conventional, null hypothesis testing counterparts as observed in the original reports. The results show that the Bayesian and the null hypothesis testing approaches generally arrive at similar inferential conclusions. However, considerable differences arise in the rejections of the null hypothesis. Notably, in 64.06\% of cases when p-values fell between .01 and .05 (i.e., evidence to reject the null), the Bayesian analysis found the evidence in the primary studies to be only at an `anecdotal' level (i.e., insufficient evidence to reject the null). Practical implications, field-wide recommendations, and an introduction to free online software (https://rnorouzian.shinyapps.io/bayesian-t-tests) for Bayesian hypothesis testing are discussed.},

In this investigation, we documented an example of an important exception to this principle: Results of a multidimensional-scaling study of igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary rocks (Experiment 1) suggested that the structure of these categories is disorganized and dispersed. This finding motivated us to explore what might be the optimal procedures for teaching dispersed categories, a goal that is likely critical to science education in general. Subjects in Experiment 2 learned to classify pictures of rocks into compact or dispersed high-level categories. One group learned the categories through focused high-level training, whereas a second group was required to simultaneously learn classifications at a subtype level. Although high-level training led to enhanced performance when the categories were compact, subtype training was better when the categories were dispersed. We provide an interpretation of the results in terms of an exemplar-memory model of category learning.},

We propose that hypodescent is explained by domain-general attentional biases toward dangerous and distinctive components in conceptual representation. This cognitive mechanism derives its empirical support from several research traditions, especially from research on how people evaluate generic statements. Here, we demonstrate how liquid mixtures are categorized in ways characteristic of hypodescent. Mixtures that contain equal amounts of two liquids are categorized as whichever liquid is more dangerous or distinctive (Study 1). Dangerous and distinctive components are prioritized even when they are less than 50\% of the mixture (Study 2). The relative dangerousness or distinctiveness of liquids (Study 3) or racial groups (Study 4) predicts the strength and direction of this asymmetry. We discuss how conceptual prominence relates to previous theories of hypodescent.},

  abstract = {Abstract The hypothalamus is essential for regulation of energy homeostasis and metabolism. Feeding hypercaloric, high-fat (HF) diet induces hypothalamic arcuate nucleus injury and alters metabolism more severely in male than in female mice. The site(s) and extent of hypothalamic injury in male and female mice are not completely understood. In the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus, single-minded family basic helix-loop helix transcription factor 1 (Sim1) neurons are essential to control energy homeostasis. We tested the hypothesis that exposure to HF diet induces injury to Sim1 neurons in the PVN of male and female mice. Mice expressing membrane-bound enhanced green fluorescent protein (mEGFP) in Sim1 neurons (Sim1-Cre:Rosa-mEGFP mice) were generated to visualize the effects of exposure to HF diet on these neurons. Male and female Sim1-Cre:Rosa-mEGFP mice exposed to HF diet had increased weight, hyperleptinemia, and developed hepatosteatosis. In male and female mice exposed to HF diet, expression of mEGFP was reduced by {$>~$}40\% in Sim1 neurons of the PVN, an effect paralleled by cell apoptosis and neuronal loss, but not by microgliosis. In the arcuate nucleus of the Sim1-Cre:Rosa-mEGFP male mice, there was decreased alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone in proopiomelanocortin neurons projecting to the PVN, with increased cell apoptosis, neuronal loss, and microgliosis. These defects were undetectable in the arcuate nucleus of female mice exposed to the HF diet. Thus, injury to Sim1 neurons of the PVN is a shared feature of exposure to HF diet in mice of both sexes, while injury to proopiomelanocortin neurons in arcuate nucleus is specific to male mice.

In the present research, we explored a link between perceived deprivation of Western Muslims and endorsement of extremism. We suggest that Western-born Muslims are particularly vulnerable to the impact of perceived relative deprivation because comparisons with majority groups' peers are more salient for them than for individuals born elsewhere. Thus, we hypothesized that Western-born, compared with foreign-born, Muslims would score higher on four predictors of extremism (e.g., violent intentions), and group-based deprivation would explain these differences. Studies 1 to 6 (Ns = 59, 232, 259, 243, 104, and 366, respectively) confirmed that Western-born Muslims scored higher on all examined predictors of extremism. Mediation and meta-analysis showed that group-based relative deprivation accounted for these differences. Study 7 (N = 60) showed that these findings are not generalizable to non-Muslims.},

  abstract = {Envy is a negative state arising when we encounter others with more desirable circumstances than our own. Its converse is pity, a negative state elicited by downward comparisons towards worse-off others. Both classes of emotions first require us to infer what a person's life as a whole must be like. However, the ``focusing illusion'' suggests these impressions of others are incomplete: we may overweight extreme features (the exceptionally good circumstances of envied others and exceptionally bad circumstances of pitied others) at the cost of overlooking the smaller ups and downs of daily life, which inevitably dilute the other person's overall experience. If so, envy and pity could involve misperceiving that envied others have lives that are uniformly wonderful (overlooking that they still face smaller annoyances) and pitied others have lives that are uniformly awful (overlooking that they still enjoy smaller pleasures). Five studies support this possibility. First, participants evaluated different peers. Consistent with focalism, the more envy and pity they felt, the more disparities they perceived (Study 1)\textemdash yet the actual everyday lives of envied and pitied others were similar (Study 2). Participants then completed various defocusing tasks designed to bring to mind others' smaller ups and downs. This indeed reduced envy and pity (Studies 3\textendash 4a\textendash 4b\textendash 5), but pity proved harder to reduce (Studies 4b\textendash 5). These studies suggest the same underlying focalism may inflate feelings of envy and pity, with asymmetric regulation strategies: small annoyances spoil perceptions of a good life more than small pleasures enhance perceptions of a bad life.},

This misprediction was indeed mediated by anticipated distraction and was therefore attenuated after people were reminded of the absorbing nature of enjoyable activities (Studies 3 and 4). These studies highlight the power of hedonic experience within the moment of consumption, which has implications for managing (or mismanaging) everyday work and leisure.

  abstract = {Decreased levels of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an endogenous neuroprotective compound, in the brain are associated with the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We previously showed that DHA is a substrate of fatty acid transport protein 1 (FATP1/SLC27A1), and FATP1 is localized at the abluminal membrane of brain capillary endothelial cells. We hypothesized that amyloid {$\beta$} (A{$\beta$}) decreases FATP1-mediated cellular efflux (i.e. supply to the brain) of DHA at the blood\textendash brain barrier (BBB). Here, we tested this hypothesis using a human cerebral microvascular endothelial cell line, human cerebral microvessel endothelial cells (hCMEC/D3), as a BBB model. The efflux of DHA-d5 by hCMEC/D3 cells increased time-dependently up to 3 min. Knock-down of FATP1 with specific siRNA indicated that FATP1-mediated efflux accounts for 47.0\% of this DHA-d5 efflux. In hCMEC/D3 cells treated with A{$\beta$}25\textendash 35 (10 {$\mu$}M/24 h), which we employed as an in vitro model of the BBB in AD, FATP1 protein expression in the plasma membrane was decreased by 96.0\%, which was greater than the decrease in the whole-cell lysate, and the DHA-d5 efflux was decreased by 68.3\%. Of this 68.3\% decrease, 45.1\% (47.0 \texttimes{} 0.96) is accounted for by the decrease in FATP1-mediated efflux and the remaining 23.2\% is presumably mediated by other mechanism(s). Thus, we have established for the first time that FATP1 is a major contributor to DHA efflux from human brain capillary endothelial cells, and its efflux activity at the abluminal membrane of the cells is blocked by A{$\beta$}. This may explain the decreased DHA level in the brain of AD patients.

We investigated one important potential contaminant in such ubiquitous decisions: Evaluations become more positive when conducted later in a sequence. In four studies, (a) judges' ratings of professional dance competitors rose across 20 seasons of a popular television series, (b) university professors gave higher grades when the same course was offered multiple times, and (c) in an experimental test of our hypotheses, evaluations of randomly ordered short stories became more positive over a 2-week sequence. As judges completed repeated evaluations, they experienced more fluent decision making, producing more positive judgments (Study 4 mediation). This seemingly simple bias has widespread and impactful consequences for evaluations of all kinds. We also report four supplementary studies to bolster our findings and address alternative explanations.},

Correspondingly, faces manipulated to appear competent but not attractive were more likely to be classified as male (Experiment 3). When masculinity cues that induced competence impressions were applied to real-life images, these cues were more effective on male faces (Experiment 4). These findings suggest that the main components of competence impressions are attractiveness, confidence, and masculinity, and they reveal gender biases in how we form important impressions of other people.},

In two different data sets covering 34 countries, economic growth was not associated with increases in happiness when it was accompanied by growing income inequality. Earlier instances of the Easterlin paradox (i.e., economic growth not being associated with increasing happiness) can thus be explained by the frequent concurrence of economic growth and growing income inequality. These findings suggest that a more even distribution of growth in national wealth may be a precondition for raising nationwide happiness.},

I argue that these explanations require a longer time horizon than the empirical evidence permits. Education, for example, typically ends in young adulthood and so cannot logically mediate the effect of income on participation in late adulthood. To resolve this temporal problem, I propose that there are two income-participation gaps: one based on current economic status and another on childhood economic history. I situate this argument in a developmental framework and present evidence for it using six studies. The results, while mixed at times, indicate that there are two gaps, that the size of each gap changes over the life course, and that their joint effect creates a larger income-participation gap than estimated by prior research.},

Often this comes independently of (or as a counterforce to) official responses by the political leadership. Research has not yet clarified the effect of such public expressions of remorse on intergroup forgiveness, nor has it explicated their role in a collective apology. We propose that grassroots gestures of remorse by collectives of the offender group may enhance intergroup forgiveness among victim group members because they exert a particularly powerful influence on perceptions of prototypical group sentiment. Four experiments (Ns = 434, 204, 600, 278) varied information about the provision of a leader apology and the grassroots public response to an intergroup transgression. Results show that grassroots responses can enhance victim group perceptions of offender group remorse, as well as subsequent feelings of forgiveness toward the offender group. In contrast, leader apologies generally failed to increase perceived remorse or promote intergroup forgiveness. Patterns were largely consistent across varying forms of grassroots responses (i.e., sorry demonstrations, letter-writing, social media buzz, public opinion polls), diverse transgression contexts (i.e., racial violence, carnage during combat, symbolic insult, ethnic conflict), and among different national groups. Results illustrate the potential power of grassroots remorse for promoting intergroup forgiveness.},

Liberals' suppression of stereotypes about the anticipated partner led to worse self-regulation when the anticipated partner was conservative but better self-regulation when the partner was liberal. Conservatives' stereotype accessibility did not affect their self-regulation.

First, theory-based measurement models do not fit the empirical data in terms of traditional confirmatory factor analysis. Second, measurement invariance across age, which is necessary for a meaningful interpretation of age-associated personality differences, is rarely accomplished. Finally, continuous moderator variables, such as age, are often artificially categorized. This categorization leads to bias when interpreting differences in personality across age. In this tutorial, we introduce methods to remedy these problems. We illustrate how Ant Colony Optimization can be used to sample indicators that meet prespecified demands such as model fit. Further, we use Local Structural Equation Modeling to resample and weight subjects to study differences in the measurement model across age as a continuous moderator variable. We also provide a detailed illustration for both tools with the Neuroticism scale of the openly available International Personality Item Pool \textendash{} NEO inventory using data from the UK sample (N = 15 827). Combined, both tools can remedy persistent problems in research on personality and its development.

We reanalyzed the German Revised NEO Personality Inventory normative sample (N = 11,724) and applied a genetic algorithm to select short scales that yield acceptable model fit and reliability across locally weighted samples ranging from 16 to 66 years of age.

We tested whether similarity, dissimilarity or overall trait levels on mate value, physical attractiveness, life history strategy and the Big Five personality factors predicted romantic interest at zero acquaintance and whether sex acted as a moderator. We tested the responders' individual perception of the targets' traits, in addition to the targets' own self?reported trait levels and a consensus rating of the targets made by the responders. We used polynomial regression with response surface analysis within multilevel modelling to test support for each of the hypotheses. Results suggest a large sex difference in trait perception; when women rated men, they agreed in their perception more often than when men rated women. However, as a predictor of romantic interest, there were no sex differences. Only the responders' perception of the targets' physical attractiveness predicted romantic interest; specifically, responders' who rated the targets' physical attractiveness as higher than themselves reported more romantic interest.

  abstract = {Locus coeruleus (LC) is the name of a group of large sized neurons located at the brain stem, which provides the main source of noradrenaline to the central nervous system, virtually, innervating the whole brain. All noradrenergic signalling provided by this nucleus is dependent on an intrinsic pacemaker process. Our study aims to understand how noradrenergic neurons finely tune their pacemaker processes and regulate their activities. Here we present that mitochondrial perturbation in the LC from mice, inhibits spontaneous firing by a hyperpolarizing response that involves Ca2+ entry via L-type Ca2+ channels and the actin cytoskeleton. We found that pharmacological perturbation of mitochondria from LC neurons using the protonophore carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), induced a dominant hyperpolarizing response when electrophysiological approaches were performed. Surprisingly, the CCCP-induced hyperpolarizing response was dependent on L-type Ca2+ channel-mediated Ca2+ entry, as it was inhibited by: the removal of extracellular Ca2+; the addition of Cd2+; nifedipine or nicardipine; but not by the intracellular dialysis with the Ca2+ chelator 1,2-Bis(2-Aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N{${'}$},N{${'}$}-tetraacetic acid, the latter indicating that the response was not because of a global change in [Ca2+]c but does not exclude action at intracellular microdomains. Further to this, the incubation of slices with cytochalasin D, an agent that depolymerises the actin cytoskeleton, inhibited the hyperpolarizing response indicating an involvement of the actin cytoskeleton. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that there is a crosstalk between mitochondria and L-type Ca2+ channels leading to modulation of noradrenergic neuronal activity mediated by the actin cytoskeleton.

Whereas theoretical accounts and empirical examinations of the sunk-cost effect have generally been based on the assumption that it is a purely intrapersonal phenomenon (i.e., solely driven by one's own past investments), the present research demonstrates that it is also an interpersonal effect (i.e., people will alter their choices in response to other people's past investments). Across eight experiments (N = 6,076) covering diverse scenarios, I documented sunk-cost effects when the costs are borne by someone other than the decision maker. Moreover, the interpersonal sunk-cost effect is not moderated by social closeness or whether other people observe their sunk costs being ``honored.'' These findings uncover a previously undocumented bias, reveal that the sunk-cost effect is a much broader phenomenon than previously thought, and pose interesting challenges for existing accounts of this fascinating human tendency.},

We investigated how social (vicarious) fear learning is affected by empathic appraisals by asking participants to either enhance or decrease their empathic responses to another individual (the demonstrator), who received electric shocks paired with a predictive conditioned stimulus. A third group of participants received no appraisal instructions and responded naturally to the demonstrator. During a later test, participants who had enhanced their empathy evinced the strongest vicarious fear learning as measured by skin conductance responses to the conditioned stimulus in the absence of the demonstrator. Moreover, this effect was augmented in observers high in trait empathy. Our results suggest that a demonstrator's expression can serve as a ``social'' unconditioned stimulus (US), similar to a personally experienced US in Pavlovian fear conditioning, and that learning from a social US depends on both empathic appraisals and the observers' stable traits.},

  abstract = {Although scholars have long studied circumstances that shape prejudice, inquiry into factors associated with long-term prejudice reduction has been more limited. Using a 6-year longitudinal study of non-Black physicians in training (N = 3,134), we examined the effect of three medical-school factors\textemdash interracial contact, medical-school environment, and diversity training\textemdash on explicit and implicit racial bias measured during medical residency. When accounting for all three factors, previous contact, and baseline bias, we found that quality of contact continued to predict lower explicit and implicit bias, although the effects were very small. Racial climate, modeling of bias, and hours of diversity training in medical school were not consistently related to less explicit or implicit bias during residency. These results highlight the benefits of interracial contact during an impactful experience such as medical school. Ultimately, professional institutions can play a role in reducing anti-Black bias by encouraging more frequent, and especially more favorable, interracial contact.},

However, there are also concerns about the representativeness and the quality of these data for clinical studies. The present work explores these issues in the specific case of major depression. Analyses of two large data sets gathered from MTurk (Sample 1: N = 2,692; Sample 2: N = 2,354) revealed two major findings: First, failing to screen for inattentive and fake respondents inflates the rates of major depression artificially and significantly (by 18.5\%\textendash 27.5\%). Second, after cleaning the data sets, depression in MTurk is still 1.6 to 3.6 times higher than general population estimates. Approximately half of this difference can be attributed to differences in the composition of MTurk samples and the general population (i.e., sociodemographics, health, and physical activity lifestyle). Several explanations for the other half are proposed, and practical data-quality tools are provided.},

In this study, which encompassed three nationally representative large-scale data sets from Ireland, the United States, and the United Kingdom (N = 17,247 after data exclusions) and included time-use-diary measures of digital-screen engagement, we used both exploratory and confirmatory study designs to introduce methodological and analytical improvements to a growing psychological research area.

  abstract = {Spontaneous Trait Inference (STI) is a psychological phenomenon that allows people to infer personality traits from others' behaviors without any intention or awareness. This phenomenon helps us organize our complex social world and ultimately it shapes our interaction with others. The goal of this manuscript is 1) to conduct a systematic analysis of the different types of measures that are currently used to detect inferences, 2) to identify their main limitations and 3) to propose a new paradigm that overcomes most of these limitations. The new paradigm is based on the modified free association task that Hourihan and MacLeod (2007) proposed as a pure conceptual implicit memory measure. This new paradigm simultaneously overcomes the contamination problem of memory measures and the dependency on data-driven processing of the activation measures. In the presented experiments we use the modified free association paradigm to detect STIs and also to compare its results to the naming task and the modified Stroop task. We show that this measure is able to reliably detect STI and discuss why it is more appropriate to study inferences. Additionally, we show that it can be used to investigate the underlying processes responsible for STI and to distinguish it from similar but different phenomena like Spontaneous Trait Transference. This manuscript focuses on STIs, but the arguments presented here apply to any research field that investigates spontaneous inference making.},

We instructed participants to simultaneously search for two target objects presented among distractors. In one condition, both targets were available, which gave the observer free choice of what to search for and allowed for proactive control. In the other condition, only one of the two targets was available, so that the choice was imposed, and a reactive mechanism would be required. No switch costs emerged when target choice was free, but switch costs emerged reliably when targets were imposed. Bridging contradictory findings, the results are consistent with models of visual selection in which only one attentional template actively drives selection and in which the efficiency of switching targets depends on the type of cognitive control allowed for by the environment.},

These effects persisted even when participants were told that their informants were highly knowledgeable about the norms. Together, these findings indicate that generic-you functions as a linguistic nudge that carries persuasive force. Broadly, they add to a growing body of literature on how subtle linguistic shifts can meaningfully influence social cognition.},

The present study investigates adults' success and strategy use in interpreting covariation data as a function of two factors that may influence performance: symmetry and context. We hypothesised that symmetrical problems, which involve comparing two candidate causes, would elicit more adequate interpretations than asymmetrical problems, which involve comparing the presence and absence of one candidate cause. We also hypothesised that problems with grounded, concrete contexts would elicit more adequate interpretations than abstract problems. College students (N = 109) interpreted contingency tables in four conditions that varied in symmetry and context. Both factors influenced correct interpretations. A latent class analysis revealed three distinct strategies: (a) compute conditional probabilities (40\%), (b) compare-two cells (23\%), and (c) anchor and compare (37\%), a novel strategy in which reasoners integrate data from all four cells in a stimulus-driven but incorrect way. Participants' use of the conditional-probabilities strategy was higher in the symmetrical than the asymmetrical conditions, and higher in the concrete than the abstract conditions. Thus, even in a sample of college students, interpreting covariation data is a skill that is not fully consolidated, but instead depends on problem structure and context.},

Using a large data set of New York City lottery gambling and a model inspired by computational accounts of reward learning, we found that people gamble more when incidental outcomes in the environment (e.g., local sporting events and sunshine) are better than expected. When local sports teams performed better than expected, or a sunny day followed a streak of cloudy days, residents gambled more. The observed relationship between prediction errors and gambling was ubiquitous across the city's socioeconomically diverse neighborhoods and was specific to sports and weather events occurring locally in New York City. Our results suggest that unexpected but incidental positive outcomes influence risk taking.},

Using a novel pupil dilation paradigm to tap cognitive effort, we exposed an ethnic minority group (Ntotal = 263) to depictions of their ingroup as disadvantaged or advantaged after they had stated four things they liked about their ethnic group (strong group identity salience) or grandmother (weak group identity salience).

Results revealed that pupil sizes were larger in the group disadvantage condition than in the group advantage condition\textemdash indicating greater cognitive effort\textemdash but only when group identity was salient (Experiment 1) or when group identification was strong (Experiment 2).

In addition, the older adults chose the more risky option more often than the younger adults in the gain and mixed domains; this difference in risk aversion was attributable to less pronounced negative affect among the older adults. Computational modeling with a hierarchical Bayesian implementation of cumulative prospect theory revealed that the older adults had higher response noise and more optimistic decision weights for gains than did the younger adults. Moreover, the older adults showed no loss aversion, a finding that supports a positivity-focus (rather than a loss-prevention) view of motivational reorientation in older age.},

Difference-in-differences analyses find no evidence that introducing collective bargaining rights led to average increases in the level of resources devoted to education. Although existing theories cannot explain these null findings, the article shows one reason behind them is that most laws granting collective bargaining rights to teachers were not unambiguously prolabor, but included both pro- and anti-union provisions.},

Following a dynamic panel data analysis methodology, we find that the strength of IP institutions has a positive effect in attracting higher levels of OFDI from China. This is an important finding for the OFDI literature from emerging markets, since previous studies have researched this relationship from the OFDI perspective of developed countries. However, we also find a weak indication of a potential U-shaped relationship between the strength of IP institutions and Chinese OFDI. To better understand this relationship, we interact a European country's membership in the Former Eastern Bloc (FEB) with the strength of IP institutions and find a negative moderating effect. We therefore find that when investing in FEB countries, Chinese firms are attracted to weaker levels of IP institutional strength. The results of this study have important implications for future studies on the determinants of OFDI from emerging markets, as well as for European and Chinese businesses and policy-makers concerning the importance of IP institutional strength.},

To test the functional relevance of M1 to action prediction, we used offline monopolar transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). In four tDCS groups of healthy participants, we administered 15~min of anodal or cathodal constant currents of 1 or 2~mA over the left M1 before participants performed two tasks requiring them to make predictions about the outcomes of reaching-grasping human actions (Action Prediction \textendash{} AP) or non-human movements (Non-human Prediction \textendash{} NP). In each group, participants received sham and active tDCS in two separate sessions. We found that 2~mA cathodal tDCS (c-tDCS2mA) selectively impaired accuracy in the AP task, but not in the NP task. No change in performance was found following anodal or 1-mA tDCS protocols. Additionally, no change was found following c-tDCS2mA administered over a control site. These findings show task-, polarity-, intensity- and site-specific disruption of AP abilities following c-tDCS2mA over M1. Thus, our study establishes specific tDCS parameters for effective M1 stimulation in AP and highlights the functional relevance of the motor system to making accurate predictions about the outcomes of human actions.},

This theory predicts that individuals with low transferable skills in the labor market will articulate a subjective sense of job insecurity and higher hostility toward migrants. Our cross-classified, longitudinal, and difference-in-differences models reveal that skill specificity is a strong driver of anti-immigrant attitudes, and they suggest that economic competition theories cannot be dismissed.

In the current research, we examined how planning the steps required for goal attainment in chronological order (i.e., forward planning) and reverse chronological order (i.e., backward planning) influences individuals' motivation for and perceptions of goal pursuit. Compared with forward planning, backward planning not only led to greater motivation, higher goal expectancy, and less time pressure but also resulted in better goal-relevant performance. We further demonstrated that this motivational effect occurred because backward planning allowed people to think of tasks required to reach their goals more clearly, especially when goals were complex to plan. These findings suggest that the way people plan matters just as much as whether or not they plan.},

Such reliance on object-based representations would predict that after an object is fully encoded into VWM, all features of that object would need to be maintained as a coherent unit. Here, we evaluated this idea by testing whether memory resources can be redeployed to a specific feature of an object already stored in VWM. We found that observers can utilize a retrospective cue presented during the maintenance period to attenuate both the gradual deterioration and complete loss of memory for a cued feature over time, but at the cost of accelerated loss of information regarding the uncued feature. Our findings demonstrate that object representations held within VWM can be decomposed into individual features and that having to retain additional features imposes greater demands on active maintenance processes.},

  abstract = {Psychological science relies on behavioral measures to assess cognitive processing; however, the field has not yet developed a tradition of routinely examining the reliability of these behavioral measures. Reliable measures are essential to draw robust inferences from statistical analyses, and subpar reliability has severe implications for measures' validity and interpretation. Without examining and reporting the reliability of measurements used in an analysis, it is nearly impossible to ascertain whether results are robust or have arisen largely from measurement error. In this article, we propose that researchers adopt a standard practice of estimating and reporting the reliability of behavioral assessments of cognitive processing. We illustrate the need for this practice using an example from experimental psychopathology, the dot-probe task, although we argue that reporting reliability is relevant across fields (e.g., social cognition and cognitive psychology). We explore several implications of low measurement reliability and the detrimental impact that failure to assess measurement reliability has on interpretability and comparison of results and therefore research quality. We argue that researchers in the field of cognition need to report measurement reliability as routine practice so that more reliable assessment tools can be developed. To provide some guidance on estimating and reporting reliability, we describe the use of bootstrapped split-half estimation and intraclass correlation coefficients to estimate internal consistency and test-retest reliability, respectively. For future researchers to build upon current results, it is imperative that all researchers provide psychometric information sufficient for estimating the accuracy of inferences and informing further development of cognitive-behavioral assessments.},

Although this apparent fickleness of memory has been extensively studied by investigating factors that build strong memory traces, researchers know less about whether memory success also depends on cognitive states that are in place when a cue is encountered. Motivating this possibility, neurocomputational models propose that the hippocampus's capacity to support associative recollection (pattern completion) is biased by persistent neurochemical states, which can be elicited by exposure to familiarity and novelty. We investigated these models' behavioral implications by assessing how recent familiarity influences different memory-retrieval processes. We found that recent familiarity selectively benefitted associative memory (Experiment 1) and that this effect decayed over seconds (Experiment 2), consistent with the timescale of hippocampal neuromodulation. Thus, we show that basic memory computations can be shaped by a subtle, biologically motivated manipulation.},

The model illustrates how electorally motivated party leaders will have an incentive to promote less competent incumbents than they would if voters did not make inferences from promotion decisions. We derive the model's empirical implications and test them with original data on the careers of Chilean senators serving between 1998 and 2013. In support of the model's insights, we find that promotion to a leadership position is an effective signal to voters only if the promoted incumbent has extreme views relative to the party.},

No order?of?learning effects emerged, suggesting that even basic prior knowledge of Chinese eliminated the advantage of initial exposure to larger units.

As an exception, two recent priming studies examined the concurrent influence of group membership and emotional expression. Quite astoundingly, they leave the reader with two divergent outcomes: while Weisbuch and Ambady (2008) observed an interactive influence of emotional expression and group membership on evaluative reactions, Craig et al. (2014) found that group membership did not contribute to the implicit evaluation of positive and negative emotional expressions. In order to shed light on this matter, we conducted three high-powered experiments using prime images of highly relevant in-group and out-group members expressing happiness and fear. We furthermore varied the social context of the priming task in order to give the ``interaction hypothesis'' a chance. However, we found no evidence for the interaction reported by Weisbuch and Ambady. In contrast to Craig et al., we found that both emotional expression and group membership independently contributed to implicit evaluations. Differences are discussed in terms of relevance of the employed groups, test power, and the time-scale of underlying processes.},

First, we tested a new approach to affect regulation dynamics, conceptualized as a network made up of the reciprocal influences that affect and affect regulation strategies constantly exert on each other. Second, we attempted to gain a better understanding of these dynamics by examining how they vary according to broad personality traits. To this end, we adopted an experience sampling method, involving five daily assessments over a 2?week period. In each assessment, participants indicated their current affective experience and the way they had implemented five well?known affect regulation strategies (i.e. appreciation, positive reappraisal, distraction, expressive suppression, and rumination) since the previous assessment. At the sample level, the network of affect regulation dynamics was characterized by positive feedback loops between positive affect and so?called broad?minded strategies, and between negative affect and narrow?minded strategies. The form of this network varied according to levels of extraversion and neuroticism. Our findings are discussed in light of current knowledge about personality and affect regulation.

Evidence suggests that this effect is attributable to persuasion rather than differential mobilization. The effectiveness of biased media varied in a politically consequential way: Its impact was largest on voters with strong pro-Russian priors but was less effective, and to some degree even counter-effective, in persuading those with strong pro-Western priors. Our finding suggests that exposing an already polarized society to a biased media source can result in even deeper polarization.},

This process creates a causal link between limb movements and whole-body translation.

In the present study, participants rated actions of other individuals as more natural when limb movements (as a cause) occurred before body displacements (as an effect) than when limb movements temporally lagged behind body displacements. This causal expectation for human body movements not only affected perceptual impressions regarding the naturalness of observed actions but also guided the interpretation of motion cues within a more generalized causal context. We interpret these results within a framework of causality as evidence that the constraint of causal action plays an important role in perception and inference with body movements.},

  abstract = {What are the underlying mechanisms driving social facilitation? Some social psychologists have proposed that social facilitation may be driven by basic mechanisms such as the level of arousal produced by the presence of an audience, while others have ascribed it to more socially and cognitively complex drivers such as a self-aware quest for social approval. In a now seminal study, Zajonc, Heingartner, and Herman (ZHH) (1969) demonstrated that the audience effect of social facilitation was exhibited in the Blatta orientalis cockroach: cockroaches were faster to complete a simple task (traversing a runway) when among other cockroaches than when alone, yet slower when the task was complex (traversing a maze). This finding suggested that arousal was a likely driver of social facilitation in the cockroach (since self-aware mechanisms were unlikely to apply). It also invited consideration of the possibility that arousal may be a contributing factor to social facilitation in humans. Despite ZHH's influence, a faithful direct replication has never been attempted. Such a replication is crucial in illuminating the underlying drivers of social facilitation.},

Previous research has identified various ways in which volume estimates are biased but typically has not presented a psychological process by which such judgments are made. Our simulation-informsperception account proposes that people often estimate a container's size by simulating filling it. First, this produces an orientation effect: The same container is judged larger when right side up than when upside down because of the greater ease of imagining filling an upright container. Second, we identified a cavern effect: Imagining pouring water through a narrow opening toward a relatively wide base produces a sense that the container is cavernous and large (compared with identically sized, wide-topped, narrow-based containers). By testing for and demonstrating the importance of simulation to these effects, we showed how complex perceptual judgments can be distorted by higher level cognitive influences even when they are necessarily informed by modularly processed perceptual input.},

In Study 2, we found that consumers' perceptions of the healthfulness and prevalence of organic products in many food categories are accurate. Finally, in Study 3, we found that people perceive organic products as more healthful than nonorganic products when the statistical structure justifies this inference. Our findings suggest that people believe organic foods are more healthful than nonorganic foods and use an organic-food cue to guide their behavior because organic foods are, on average, 30\% more healthful.},

In three experimental tasks commonly used to assess altruism, reciprocity, and trust in humans, we found no evidence in favor of the hypotheses; nine main tests were preregistered, and all of them yielded small and statistically insignificant estimates. In secondary analyses, we used Bayesian inference and estimation to quantify support for our findings. Taken together, our results strongly suggest that the link between OPRM1 A118G variation and social-rejection sensitivity is weaker than previously thought.},

Study 1 showed that participants in the deviance conditions reported having a greater understanding of campus social norms than those in the control condition; they also expressed a greater desire to gossip about the video. Study 2 found that when given the opportunity, participants did gossip about the deviance, and this gossip was associated with increased norm clarification and (indirectly) social cohesion.

Despite fewer years of English instruction, participants' vocabulary knowledge in English was considerably larger than their French vocabulary knowledge, which can be explained by their large amounts of out-of-school exposure to English language input. Participants' online activities in particular had a positive effect on their vocabulary knowledge in English. Although gender influenced participants' engagement with online activities in English, gender did not have a direct effect on their vocabulary knowledge, as the structural equation modeling analysis showed.

Yet the psychological categories that are involved and the selection pressures that underlie these categories remain unclear. A common view is that human pathogen-avoidance psychology is specifically adapted to avoid out-groups because of their potentially different pathogens. However, the series of studies reported here shows that there is no dedicated category for reasoning about out-groups in terms of pathogens. Specifically, a memory-confusion experiment conducted with two large-scale samples of Americans (one nationally representative) yielded strong, replicable evidence that healthy out-group members are represented using the same psychological category that is used to represent manifestly infected in-group members. This suggests that the link between out-group prejudice and pathogen concerns is a by-product of general mechanisms for treating any unfamiliar appearance as an infection cue.},

  abstract = {Decades of research indicate that the traits we ascribe to people often depend on their race. Yet, the bulk of this research has not considered how racial stereotypes might also depend on other aspects of targets' identities. To address this, researchers have begun to ask intersectional questions about racial stereotypes, such as whether they are applied in similar ways to men and women, or to children and adults. In the present studies, we examine whether men who are described as gay (vs. not) become de-racialized in the minds of perceivers. That is, we test whether gay (vs. non-gay) men are perceived as less stereotypic of their own racial or ethnic groups. Results consistently support the de-racialization hypothesis, regardless of whether targets are Black, White, Asian, or Hispanic. Moreover, when Black and Hispanic men are described as gay (vs. not), they become stereotypically ``Whitened'' in addition to seeming less stereotypic of their own racial groups. This ``Whitening'' effect is explained by Black and Hispanic men's seeming more affluent when described as gay (vs. when not), an effect that holds even when controlling for changes in these men's stereotypic femininity. Collectively, these findings underscore the point that race and sexual orientation are not orthogonal in the minds of perceivers. A minority sexual orientation can alter the racial characteristics ascribed to men, reducing the perceived presence of race-typical traits and, for low-SES men, increasing their perceived ``Whiteness.''},

  abstract = {Research Summary Game theory suggests that, in oligopolistic markets characterized by nonprice competition, dominant incumbents can use product proliferation to occupy a region of the product space (i.e., a subspace) and deter rivals from imitating their products. In part, this is because product proliferation makes the introduction of close substitutes comparatively less profitable; in part, it is because the strategy conveys a threat of retaliation to potential imitators. Yet this threat is only credible if the proliferator has high costs of exit from the occupied region of space. We hypothesize that complexity, as a property of product (sub)spaces, generates exit costs for the proliferator and increases the deterrent power of its strategy. We test this hypothesis by studying sequential product introductions in the U.S. recording industry, 2004\textendash 2014. Managerial Summary Differentiated-product markets are often concentrated in the hands of a few dominant organizations, which strive to keep on equal footing by offering similar products. In these markets, a product proliferation strategy can help one of the dominant incumbents claim a particular submarket as its territory. Investing heavily in that submarket communicates a threat that the proliferator will retaliate against invaders to protect these investments. However, this threat is not credible enough to deter rivals unless the occupied submarket is sufficiently complex in terms of product attributes, as precisely this kind of complexity makes it harder for proliferators to back down if challenged. We find evidence of this mechanism in an analysis of product competition among major record companies and discuss implications for strategic decision-making.

In two experiments, we explored who acts as an effective identity-safe cue for Black women at a fictitious science and technology company. Experiment 1 found Black women predicted they would feel more trust and belonging at a STEM company with a website featuring a Black woman or Black man scientist compared to a White woman scientist or no scientist. In Experiment 2, we found relative to viewing no scientist, Black women predicted they would feel more trust and belonging when a STEM company highlighted a Black woman scientist, or White woman scientist who expressed allyship with Black women (i.e., stating Black women bring important perspectives to science). Interestingly, across both experiments we found stigma consciousness (i.e., sensitivity to the possibility of experiencing discrimination) moderated these results, and had important implications for Black women's reported feelings of trust and belonging. Specifically, participants with higher stigma consciousness anticipated they would feel less trust and belonging at a company unless they viewed the profile featuring a Black woman scientist.},

Identity-safe cues (i.e., scientists with shared identities), may address this issue and encourage Latinas' belonging and interest in STEM. To examine this possibility, in the first study, we presented Latina women with a fictional STEM company and a scientist working at the company who was either Latino/a or a non-Latino/a White man or woman. We found that compared to those in the White man or woman scientist conditions, participants in the Latino/a scientist conditions believed the scientist had faced comparable adversity to themselves, identified more strongly with the scientist, and reported higher trust and belonging and attraction to the STEM company. Using the findings from Study 1 to inform a new intervention, in the second study we presented Latina high school students with a panel of Latina scientists. Relative to before the panel, the students reported enhanced feelings of trust and belonging in STEM after the panel. Exploratory analyses further revealed that among Latina students who did not already intend to pursue a career in STEM, the panel encouraged their interest in the sciences. Across both studies, we found that believing the scientists had past experiences with adversity related to stronger identification with the scientists, and identifying with scientists correlated with more trust and belonging and interest in STEM environments. The current research has important implications for who acts as an identity-safe cue for Latinas in STEM.},

Econometric analyses revealed that postseason performance of a focal team's rival in year N predicted that focal team's postseason performance in year N + 1. Follow-up analyses suggested that the performance boost was especially pronounced when one's rival won the previous tournament. These results establish that rivalry has a long shadow: A rival team's success exerts such a powerful motivational force that it drives performance outside of direct competition with one's rival and even after a significant delay.},

In three experiments, we demonstrated that individuals erroneously assume that evidence that is equally predicted by two competing hypotheses offers no support for either hypothesis. However, this assumption holds only in cases in which competing causes are mutually exclusive and exhaustive (i.e., exactly one cause is true). We argue that this reasoning error is due to a zero-sum perspective on evidence, wherein people assume that evidence that supports one causal hypothesis must disconfirm its competitor. Thus, evidence cannot give positive support to both competitors. Across three experiments (N = 49, N = 193, N = 201), we demonstrated that this error is robust to intervention and generalizes across several different contexts. We also ruled out several alternative explanations of the bias.},

Specifically, we propose that opposition to same-sex marriage can be explained in terms of (a) individual differences in short-term mating orientation and (b) mental associations between homosexuality and sexual promiscuity. We created a novel Implicit Association Test to measure mental associations between homosexuality and promiscuity. We found that mental associations between homosexuality and promiscuity, at both the implicit and the explicit levels, interacted with short-term mating orientation to predict opposition to same-sex marriage. Our model accounted for 42.3\% of the variation in attitudes toward same-sex marriage, and all predictors remained robust when we controlled for potential confounds. Our results reveal the centrality of mating psychology in attitudes toward same-sex marriage.},

Yet, despite dramatic changes in women's sex hormone levels and bodies during and after pregnancy, previous between-subject and case studies have not found systematic changes in F0 due to pregnancy. Here, we tracked within-individual variation in 20 mothers' voices during their first pregnancy, as well as up to 5 years before conception and 5 years postpartum. Voice recordings from 20 age-matched nulliparous women were measured as a control. Linear Mixed Models indicated that F0 mean, range and variation changed significantly following pregnancy in mothers, controlling for age at time of recording, whereas we did not observe any F0 changes across corresponding timeframes in our sample of nulliparous controls. Mothers' voices became significantly lower-pitched and more monotonous during the first year postpartum compared to during pregnancy or before. These F0 parameters did not decrease within-individuals over a 5-year period prior to conception above and beyond the effects of ageing. Although voice pitch decreased following pregnancy, mothers' F0 parameters reverted after the first year postpartum, approaching pre-pregnancy levels. Our results demonstrate that pregnancy has a transient and perceptually salient masculinizing effect on women's voices.},

Employing a novel ambiguous-dice paradigm, we asked participants to report the outcome of the die roll appearing closest to the location of a previously presented fixation cross on a computer screen; this outcome would determine their pay. We varied the value of the die second closest to the fixation cross to be either higher (i.e., tempting) or lower (i.e., not tempting) than the die closest to the fixation cross. Results of two experiments revealed that in ambiguous settings, people's incorrect responses were self-serving.

Given this preference, people wishing to be chosen can either increase their own cooperation to become more desirable or suppress others' cooperation to make them less desirable. Previous research shows that very cooperative people sometimes get punished (``antisocial punishment'') or criticized (``do-gooder derogation'') in many cultures. Here, we used a public-goods game with punishment to test whether antisocial punishment is used as a means of competing to be chosen by suppressing others' cooperation. As predicted, there was more antisocial punishment when participants were competing to be chosen for a subsequent cooperative task (a trust game) than without a subsequent task. This difference in antisocial punishment cannot be explained by differences in contributions, moralistic punishment, or confusion. This suggests that antisocial punishment is a social strategy that low cooperators use to avoid looking bad when high cooperators escalate cooperation.},

In these situations, it is essential to form expectations about the others' behaviour to adapt one's own behaviour to increase mutual outcomes and avoid exploitation. Social value orientation, which describes the dispositional weights individuals attach to their own and to another person's outcome, predicts these expectations of cooperation in social dilemmas?an interdependent situation involving a conflict of interests. Yet, scientific evidence is inconclusive about the exact differences in expectations between prosocials, individualists, and competitors. The present meta?analytic results show that, relative to proselfs (individualists and competitors), prosocials expect more cooperation from others in social dilemmas, whereas individualists and competitors do not significantly differ in their expectations. The importance of these expectations in the decision process is further highlighted by the finding that they partially mediate the well?established relation between social value orientation and cooperative behaviour in social dilemmas. In fact, even proselfs are more likely to cooperate when they expect their partner to cooperate. Copyright ? 2018 European Association of Personality Psychology},

Then we established that perceiving the electoral system as broken statistically mediated the effect of high and low polarization on greater desire for inclusion. We next demonstrated experimental mediation in two ways: via a manipulation-of-mediator design (Pirlott \& MacKinnon, 2016) in which we manipulated the proposed mediator (i.e., perceived electoral system brokenness) and, separately, via a moderation-of process design (Spencer, Zanna, \& Fong, 2005) in which we simultaneously manipulated both perceived polarization and perceived brokenness. Both perceived issue polarization (high and low versus medium, and high versus low, excluding medium) and perceived brokenness exert causal effects on greater desire for inclusion of a third party candidate. When people perceive high and low issue polarization and when people perceive brokenness in the electoral system they support actions that pose potential fixes to the brokenness, such as including a third-party or independent candidate in elections.},

  abstract = {Hindsight bias is the tendency to overestimate one's prior knowledge of a fact or event after learning the actual fact. Recent research has suggested that age-related differences in hindsight bias may be based on age-related differences in inhibitory control. We tested whether this explanation held for 3 cognitive processes assumed to underlie hindsight bias: recollection bias, reconstruction bias, and the tendency to adopt newly acquired knowledge as old. We performed a typical hindsight-bias study with 9-year-olds, 12-year-olds, young adults, and older adults. Participants first gave numerical judgments to difficult almanac questions. They later received the correct judgments for some of the questions while trying to recall their own earlier judgments. To experimentally test the impact of inhibitory control, the correct judgment was presented either in a weak or in a strong manner that was difficult to ignore. Hindsight bias was larger in the strong condition than in the weak condition and followed a U-shaped life-span pattern with young adults showing the least hindsight bias in line with an inhibitory-control explanation. Yet, the mixture of underlying processes differed considerably between age groups, so inhibitory control did not suffice as a sole explanation of age differences.},

We addressed this question by investigating whether 12-month-olds used preverbal categories to discover the meanings of new words. We showed that one group of infants (n = 18) readily extended novel labels to previously unseen exemplars of preverbal visual categories after only a single labeling episode, but two other groups struggled to do so when taught labels for unfamiliar categories (those who had been previously exposed, n = 18, or not exposed, n = 18, to category tokens). These results suggest that infants expect labels to denote categories of objects and are equipped with learning mechanisms responsible for matching prelinguistic knowledge structures with linguistic inputs. This ability is consistent with the idea that our conceptual machinery provides building blocks for vocabulary and language acquisition.},

Firms with immobile assets then face higher taxes. By considering the political incentives that accompany widespread financialization, we identify a new limit to the targeting of immobile firms: Publicly traded firms with immobile underlying assets lose more value in financial markets when taxes are increased, as shareholders anticipate that these underlying assets cannot be withheld from taxation. When governments care about this loss in value, their incentive to tax immobile, publicly traded firms declines. Political concern for financial performance therefore limits the extent to which immobile assets can be targeted for taxation. We argue that broad-based participation in the stock market and democratic political institutions increase political concern for financial performance. We discuss the implications of the theory and findings for policy autonomy, firm ownership, and economic voting.},

This effect was cumulative: Performance increased when more preceding study items were to be forgotten. The effect decreased when memory was conditioned on instructions for items appearing farther back in the study list. Experiment 2 used a dual-task paradigm that suppressed, during encoding, verbal rehearsal or attentional refreshing. Neither task removed the effect, ruling out that rehearsal or attentional borrowing is responsible for the advantage conferred from previous to-be-forgotten items. We propose that memory formation depletes a limited resource that recovers over time and that to-be-forgotten items consume fewer resources, leaving more resources available for storing subsequent items.

Previous research has found linguistic intergroup bias (LIB) in individuals' speech: They use abstract language to describe in-group targets' desirable behaviors and concrete language to describe their undesirable behaviors (favorable LIB), but use concrete language for out-group targets' desirable behaviors and abstract language for their undesirable behaviors (unfavorable LIB). Consequently, one can infer the type of language a communicator is likely to use to describe in-group and out-group targets. We hypothesized and found evidence for the reverse inference. Across four studies, individuals inferred a communicator's social identity on the basis of the communicator's use of an LIB. Specifically, participants more strongly believed that a communicator and target shared a social identity when the communicator used the favorable, rather than the unfavorable, LIB in describing that target.},

  abstract = {Trusting the trustworthy brings benefits whereas trusting the untrustworthy brings harm. Discriminating between the two is key to every social encounter. We propose that humans turn to internal information, namely the self, when judging the trustworthiness of others. Simulating how oneself would behave in situations that involve trust helps to predict how a counterpart may behave. Importantly, using the same self as a basis for judgments about others may result in diverging outcomes, depending on how the information is processed. If a judge focuses on similarities between the self and the target person, the judge expects the counterpart to act alike. However, if a judge focuses on differences, the target is expected to behave in ways opposite to the self. In Study 1, natural variations in self-ascribed levels of trustworthiness correlate positively with expectations of a target person's trustworthiness. Inducing a similarity-focus increases this correlation as compared to a difference-focus. Interestingly, this effect holds even if information speaks to the target's trustworthiness. In manipulating the perception of the participants' own trustworthiness as well as the processing focus, Studies 2\textendash 4 demonstrate that when individuals focus on similarities, those who perceive themselves as highly (vs. less) trustworthy perceive others as similarly highly (less) trustworthy. However, when they focus on differences, the reverse pattern tends to occur. These effects hold for trust judgments (Study 2\textendash 3) and trust behavior in an economic game (Study 4). Together, these findings demonstrate that trust involves egocentric inferences that are flexible enough to adjust for basic social relations.},

Individual differences in perception should therefore be jointly determined by a person's sensitivity to incoming evidence and his or her prior expectations. It has been proposed that individuals with autism have flatter prior distributions than do nonautistic individuals, which suggests that prior variance is linked to the degree of autistic traits in the general population. We tested this idea by studying how perceived speed changes during pursuit eye movement and at low contrast. We found that individual differences in these two motion phenomena were predicted by differences in thresholds and autistic traits when combined in a quantitative Bayesian model. Our findings therefore support the flatter-prior hypothesis and suggest that individual differences in prior expectations are more systematic than previously thought. In order to be revealed, however, individual differences in sensitivity must also be taken into account.},

  abstract = {Abstract The protein alpha-synuclein whose expression is strongly implicated in Parkinson's disease (PD) is not only expressed in the CNS but also in the enteric nervous system (ENS). The growing body of evidence suggesting that gastrointestinal inflammation is involved in the development of PD led us to investigate the effects of inflammation on alpha-synuclein expression in primary culture of rat ENS and in mice with dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis. Using western blot and qPCR, we found that both lipopolysaccharide and a combination of tumor necrosis factor-{$\alpha$} and interleukin 1-? decreased the expression levels of alpha-synuclein in primary culture of rat ENS, an effect that was prevented in the presence of the p38 inhibitors SB203580 and BIRB 796. Lipopolysaccharide and tumor necrosis factor-{$\alpha$}/interleukin 1-? had no effect on alpha-synuclein expression in primary culture of rat CNS and in human erythroid leukemia cells. In mice, acute but not chronic dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis was associated with a decreased expression of colonic alpha-synuclein. As a whole, our findings indicate that acute inflammatory insults down-regulate alpha-synuclein expression in the ENS via a p38 pathway. They provide new insights into the widely discussed concepts of alpha-synuclein expression and aggregation in the ENS in PD and raise issues about the possible role of gastrointestinal inflammation in the development of PD.

Here, we investigated whether time pressure increases socially desirable responding outside social interactions (Study 1). Finding that it did, we then examined whether this is because people align their responses with the concept of their ``true'' self or because of an intuitive tendency to comply with norms (Study 2). In Study 1, we randomly assigned each of 1,500 Americans to answer a measure of social-desirability bias either quickly or slowly and found that quick responding increased social desirability. In Study 2, we recruited a similar sample and tested whether fast-responding effects were moderated by the extent to which people display a good-true-self bias. A greater tendency to ascribe good behaviors to the true self predicted social desirability, but this relationship disappeared under time pressure. These results of socially desirable behavior under time pressure do not reflect people's deep-down good selves but, rather, their desire to present themselves favorably to other people.},

Different views have been proposed of how function is distributed along its long axis: one view suggests segregation, whereas the alternative view postulates a more gradual organisation. Here, we applied a novel `connectopic mapping' data-analysis approach to the resting-state fMRI data of participants of the Human Connectome Project, and demonstrate that the functional organisation of the hippocampal longitudinal axis is gradual rather than segregated into parcels. In addition, we show that inter-individual variations in this gradual organisation predict variations in recollection memory better than a characterisation based on functional parcellation. These results present an important step forward in understanding the functional organisation of the human hippocampus and have important implications for translating between rodent and human research.},

We collected data from 616 Flemish children between 10 and 12 years old by using a questionnaire about learners' extramural English, an English vocabulary test, and a Dutch vocabulary test. The findings revealed that participating learners frequently engaged in activities involving English before receiving formal instruction and that their amount of extramural English increased with age. The results also showed the rate of vocabulary growth from exposure to extramural English for three contiguous age groups. Further, both word-related and learner-related variables predicted vocabulary knowledge. Cognateness was the most powerful predictor, followed by frequency and concreteness. We also found a positive relationship between extramural English and vocabulary knowledge. Open Practices This article has been awarded an Open Materials badge.

To investigate the role of age in this diversity, the present study examined whether emerging adults differ from an older group of young adults in their Big Five personality development. By means of multi-group latent change modelling, two groups of 16- to 19-year-olds (n = 3555) and 26- to 29-year-olds (n = 2621) were tracked over the course of four years and compared regarding four aspects of personality change: mean-level change, rank-order change, inter-individual differences in change, and profile change. In addition, age-differential socialization effects associated with six first-time life events were investigated. Analyses revealed substantial age differences in all four aspects of change. As expected, emerging adults showed greater change and diversity in change than young adults. However, the six life events had no age-differential impact on change in single traits and Big Five profiles. Overall, the results indicate that age differences should be considered even in specific life stages to advance the understanding of personality development. \textcopyright{} 2018 European Association of Personality Psychology},

The mean state estimates ranged from 9\% (Iowa) to 41\% (Virginia), with the total contribution for all states equaling 907\%, indicating strong collective narcissism. In comparison, ratings provided by nonresidents for states were much lower (but still high). Surprisingly, asking people questions about U.S. history before they made their judgment did not lower estimates.

Critically, misinformation led to improved recognition of the original event when subjects detected and remembered a change between the original event and the postevent information. Our research agrees with other findings from retroactive-interference paradigms and can be interpreted within the recursive-remindings framework, according to which detecting and remembering change can enhance retention. We conclude that the misinformation effect occurs mostly for witnessed details that are not particularly memorable. In the case of more memorable details, providing misinformation can actually facilitate later recollection of the original events.},

Before the beginning of the movement of the PL stimuli, only in the presence of the object evoked attenuation of sensorimotor alpha activity was documented, possibly interpreted either as movement prediction or as graspable object perception. Our main findings demonstrate that, during observation of stimuli moving with biological kinematics, the infants' sensorimotor system is activated when the pictorial information is absent or highly reduced, and independently of the presence of the goal-directed object.

Results replicated previous associations of change goals with age and self-rated traits.

While there is some evidence for this phenomenon in the visual and, to a lesser extent, the auditory modality, little is known about whether it operates in the complex auditory contexts of daily life. Here, we examined how prediction error responses behave in a more complex and ecologically valid auditory context than those typically studied. We created musical tone sequences with different degrees of pitch uncertainty to manipulate the precision of participants' auditory expectations. Magnetoencephalography was used to measure the magnetic counterpart of the mismatch negativity (MMNm) as a neural marker of prediction error in a multi-feature paradigm. Pitch, slide, intensity and timbre deviants were included. We compared high-entropy stimuli, consisting of a set of non-repetitive melodies, with low-entropy stimuli consisting of a simple, repetitive pitch pattern. Pitch entropy was quantitatively assessed with an information-theoretic model of auditory expectation. We found a reduction in pitch and slide MMNm amplitudes in the high-entropy as compared to the low-entropy context. No significant differences were found for intensity and timbre MMNm amplitudes. Furthermore, in a separate behavioral experiment investigating the detection of pitch deviants, similar decreases were found for accuracy measures in response to more fine-grained increases in pitch entropy. Our results are consistent with a precision modulation of auditory prediction error in a musical context, and suggest that this effect is specific to features that depend on the manipulated dimension\textemdash pitch information, in this case.},

However, empirical support for this widely held view is surprisingly mixed, and this view does little to clarify which social partner a person will be motivated to interact with when happy. To address these issues, we monitored the happiness and social interactions of more than 30,000 people for a month. We found that patterns of social interaction followed the hedonic-flexibility principle, whereby people tend to engage in happiness-enhancing social relationships when they feel bad and sustain happiness-decreasing periods of solitude and less pleasant types of social relationships that might promise long-term payoff when they feel good. These findings demonstrate that links between happiness and social behavior are more complex than often assumed in the positive-emotion literature.},

The microarchitecture of wing bristles limits the use of electrophysiology methods to investigate wing chemosensory mechanisms. However, by monitoring the fluorescence of the complex calcium/GCaMP, calcium flux triggered upon tastant stimulation was observed within sensilla aligned along the wing anterior nerve. This string of fluorescent puncta was impaired in wings of Innexin 2 (Inx2) mutant flies; although it is unclear whether the Innexin proteins act at the level of the wing imaginal disc, adult wing and/or at both levels. Glial cells known to shelter Innexin(s) expression have no documented role in adult chemosensory sensilla. Our data suggest that Innexin(s) are likely required for the maturation of functional wing chemosensilla in adulthood. The unexpected presence of most Innexin transcripts in adult wing RNAseq data set argues for the expression of Innexin proteins in the larval imaginal wing disc that are continued in wing chemosensilla at adulthood.

  abstract = {People live in a continuous environment in which the visual scene changes on a slow timescale. It has been shown that to exploit such environmental stability, the brain creates a continuity field in which objects seen seconds ago influence the perception of current objects. What is unknown is whether a similar mechanism exists at the level of metacognitive representations. In three experiments, we demonstrated a robust intertask confidence leak\textemdash that is, confidence in one's response on a given task or trial influencing confidence on the following task or trial. This confidence leak could not be explained by response priming or attentional fluctuations. Better ability to modulate confidence leak predicted higher capacity for metacognition as well as greater gray matter volume in the prefrontal cortex. A model based on normative principles from Bayesian inference explained the results by postulating that observers subjectively estimate the perceptual signal strength in a stable environment. These results point to the existence of a novel metacognitive mechanism mediated by regions in the prefrontal cortex.},

It was predicted that if infants possess such a template, then they would attend preferentially to schematic images of these nonhuman animal stimuli relative to scrambled versions of the same stimuli. The results revealed that infants looked longer at a schematic snake than at 2 scrambled versions of the image and generalized from real snakes to the schematic image. The experiments also demonstrated that 5-month-olds showed no preferential looking for schematic sharks or schematic rodents relative to scrambled versions of those images.

  abstract = {The etiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is multifactorial, complex, and likely involves interactions among genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors. With respect to environmental influences, a growing literature implicates intrauterine experiences in the origin of this pervasive developmental disorder. In this prospective longitudinal study, we examined the hypothesis that fetal exposure to maternal cortisol may confer ASD risk. In addition, because ASD is four times more prevalent in males than in females, and because sexually dimorphic responses to intrauterine experiences are commonly observed, we examined whether or not any associations differ by fetal sex. Maternal plasma cortisol was measured at 15, 19, 25, 31, and 37 weeks' gestation in a sample of 84 pregnant women. ASD symptoms were assessed in their 5-year-old children with the Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ). Fetal exposure to lower levels of maternal cortisol was associated with higher levels of ASD symptoms only among boys. The observed hypocortisolemic profile exhibited by these mothers may indicate a risk factor that precedes the stress of caregiving for a child with ASD and may not be solely a consequence of the stress of caregiving, as previously thought. These findings confirm the value of examining prenatal hormone exposures as predictors of ASD risk and support the premise that altered prenatal steroid exposures may play a role in the etiology of ASD.},

  abstract = {Negative generalization asymmetry (NGA) is a tendency to generalize negative attitudes more widely than positive attitudes. Studies found robust NGA for new objects that resemble both positive and negative learned objects, and even stronger NGA for new objects that resemble neither. Two biases were suggested to underlie NGA: (1) negative response bias, whereby a novel object is perceived as novel, but forced to make a dichotomous good/bad decision, a responder has a strategy to classify it as bad; (2) negative weighting-of-similarity bias, whereby a novel object seems more similar to negative learned objects than to positive learned objects. We hypothesized that adding a third response alternative, ``cannot be evaluated'', to the good/bad response alternatives commonly used in the BeanFest paradigm would reduce negative response bias but not negative weighting-of-similarity. As predicted, the new response alternative was used more as similarity to learned stimuli decreased. Also as predicted, NGA, although still significant, was lower in the 3-alternatives condition. Interestingly, extent of reduction in NGA due to adding the new response alternative did not vary as a function of stimulus type, and was not particularly strong for stimuli very dissimilar to any learned stimuli. These results confirm that NGA is indeed partly due to response bias. They additionally suggest that increased NGA with decreasing similarity to learned stimuli cannot be attributed solely to negative response bias. Thus, avoidance of new, unfamiliar objects does not reflect only strategic caution, but rather reflects to a large extent a na\"ive-realistic belief that they are negative.},

Objective Forced swimming test (FST) in rodents is a widely used behavioural test for screening antidepressants in preclinical research. Translational value of preclinical studies may be improved by appraisal of the quality of experimental design and risk of biases, which remains to be addressed for FST. The present protocol of a systematic review with meta-analysis aims to investigate the quality of preclinical studies employing FST to identify risks of bias in future publications. In addition, this protocol will help to determine the effect sizes (ES) for primary and secondary outcomes according to several aspects of the FST study design.
Search strategy, Screening annotation, Data management Publications reporting studies testing different classes of antidepressants in FST will be collected from Medline, SCOPUS and Web of Science databases. A broad list of inclusion criteria will be applied excluding those studies whereby FST is used as a stressor or studies reporting data from co-treatments. For assessing the quality of the included publications, the quality checklist adapted by Collaborative Approach to Meta-Analysis and Review of Animal Data from Experimental Studies will be used. If the meta-analysis seems feasible, the ES and the 95\% CI will be analysed. The heterogeneity between studies will be assessed by using the {$\chi$}2statistic with n-1 degrees of freedom. Subgroup meta-analysis (meta-regression, and if necessary, stratified regression) will be performed when possible according to characteristics of study design and study quality to assess their impact on efficacy of the treatments. In addition, funnel plotting, Egger regression, and `trim and fill' will be used to assess the risk of publication bias. Results of this protocol will help to create rational methodological guidelines for application of FST in rodents and improve the quality and translational value of preclinical research on antidepressant discovery.
Reporting A preliminary version of the present protocol has been preregistered with Systematic Review Facility (http://syrf.org.uk/). A preprint version of the current protocol has been registered with Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/9kxm4/). Results will be communicated in scientific meetings and peer-reviewed journals. We plan to conduct an anonymous and online survey within the scientific community to ask researchers about their perception of risk of bias and their experience with the publication of negative results.},

In a computational simulation, we showed that the patterns of change in PAL scores are actually predicted by the models that formalize the associative learning process in other areas of behavioral and neuroscientific research. These models also predict that manipulating language exposure can reproduce the experience-related performance differences erroneously attributed to age-related decline in age-matched adults. Consistent with this, results showed that older bilinguals outperformed native speakers in a German PAL test, an advantage that increased with age. These analyses and results show that age-related PAL performance changes reflect the predictable effects of learning on the associability of test items, and indicate that failing to control for these effects is distorting the understanding of cognitive and brain development in adulthood.},

Previous research is mixed on whether episodic or semantic memories are most important for supporting identity. The present study examined autobiographical memories cued by self-images (e.g., I am a father) and non-self-related cues in 16 AD patients and 29 healthy older adults. The AD group generated fewer self-images and memories compared to controls, but demonstrated similar temporal organization of self-cued memories. In both groups, self-images were supported by semantic memories that were temporally clustered around times of identity-formation. These self-supporting memories are proposed to form a scaffold to support the self and may persist the longest in AD, as opposed to memories from early adulthood per se. In both AD and control groups, self-images cued more semantic memories than non-self-relevant cues, further suggesting that semantic autobiographical memories play a fundamental role in supporting the self. These findings demonstrate that the self remains largely intact in AD, in spite of severe episodic memory deficits and global cognitive decline. In later stages of the disease, these self-supporting memories could provide effective tools for reminiscence therapy.},

College students (N = 939) participated in a preregistered, four-wave longitudinal study over one academic year. Depression positively predicted subsequent derailment across all components of the model, suggesting that perceived disruptions in life course may occur in response to elevated depressive symptoms. Contrary to predictions, derailment negatively predicted later depression across most waves, indicating that felt changes in identity and self-direction could buffer against downstream mood deteriorations. Although our findings did not support reciprocity, prospective evidence that perceived instability of identity and self-direction relate to an increase in depressive symptoms positions derailment as a new and potentially important facet of the depressive phenotype.},

Data were collected from a multi-institution collaboration across 32 sites. Participants with a disability (N = 502) completed online, self-report measures of need to belong, sense of belonging, social support, and positive disability identity. As expected, those who perceived greater social support were more likely to report a sense of belonging (r ranged from .36 to .55, p {$<$} .05) and positive disability identity (r ranged from .18 to .41, p {$<$} .05). Positive disability identity was more strongly related to sense of belonging in those who self-identify with a disability (z = 4.16, p {$<$} .001, Cohen's q = .40). Also as hypothesized, positive disability identity predicted sense of belonging, even after controlling for the effects of social support and need to belong, in both those who identified with a disability (R2{$\Delta$} = .12, Cohens f 2 = .14) and those who did not self-identify (R2{$\Delta$} = .02, Cohens f 2 = .02). These findings suggest that, although social support and a low need to belong were associated with a strong sense of belonging, developing a positive disability identity is also important in predicting a sense of belonging in emerging adults with disabilities.},

We hypothesised that unexpectedly appearing objects that contain a feature linked to high value, as established via reward learning in a previous task, would subsequently be detected more frequently than objects containing a feature linked to low value. A total of 537 participants first learned the association between a perceptual feature (colour) and subsequent reward values (high, low, or none reward). Afterwards, participants were randomly assigned to a static (Experiment 1) or dynamic (Experiment 2) inattentional blindness task including an unexpected object associated with high, low, or none reward. However, no significant effect of the previously learned value on the subsequent likelihood of detection was observed. We speculate that artificial monetary value, which is known to affect attentional capture, is not strong enough to determine whether or not an object is consciously perceived.},

In three nationally representative survey experiments conducted across a range of policy domains, we find that the public reacts negatively when policies are achieved through unilateral powers instead of through legislation passed by Congress. We further show these costs are greatest among respondents who support the president's policy goals. In an observational study, we show that attitudes toward unilateral action in the abstract affect how respondents evaluate policies achieved through unilateral action by presidents from Lincoln to Obama.

Immediately before rating, 20 listeners heard critical comments about Quebec French speakers' English language skills, while 20 heard positive comments. Twenty listeners (baseline group) received no manipulation. Compared to baseline listeners, positively oriented listeners (younger and older) rated four of five dimensions more favorably. However, listeners' behavior diverged under negative bias.

We tested the hypothesis that the general mechanism that allows this is the maintenance of multiple target representations in working and long-term memory. We recorded subjects' event-related potentials (ERPs) indexing the working memory and long-term memory representations used to control attention while performing visual search. We found that subjects used both types of memories to control attention when they performed the visual search task with a large reward at stake, or when they were cued to respond as fast as possible. However, under normal circumstances, one type of target memory was sufficient for slower task performance. The use of multiple types of memory representations appears to provide converging top-down control of attention, allowing people to step on the attentional accelerator in a variety of high-pressure situations.},

Here we show that even a single instance of mental imagery can improve attentional selection of a target more effectively than actually practicing visual search. By recording subjects' brain activity, we found that these imagery-induced training effects were due to perceptual attention being more effectively focused on targets following imagined training. Next, we examined the downside of this potent training by changing the target after several trials of training attention with imagery and found that imagined search resulted in more potent interference than actual practice following these target changes. Finally, we found that proactive interference from task-irrelevant elements in the visual displays appears to underlie the superiority of imagined training relative to actual practice. Our findings demonstrate that visual attention mechanisms can be effectively trained to select target objects in the absence of visual input, and this results in more effective control of attention than practicing the task itself.},

Although intellectual humility describes an intrapersonal style of processing information, we theorize that it also has interpersonal roots. This article describes four experiments and one daily-diary study examining the impact of perceived partner responsiveness and unresponsiveness on two manifestations of intellectual humility, lesser self-serving bias and openness to novel information that may contradicting existing beliefs. Studies 1\textendash 3 indicated that three well-established examples of self-serving bias\textemdash the tendency to rate oneself as better than an average peer, overclaiming personal responsibility for shared household activities, and hindsight bias\textemdash were strengthened when people were induced to perceive their partners as unresponsive, but weakened when they were led to perceive their partners as responsive. Study 4, a daily-diary study, demonstrated similar effects of everyday perceptions of responsiveness on hindsight bias, and also found that people reported having been more open to considering alternative, potentially conflicting points of view when they felt that their social environment was responsive to them. Finally, Study 5 found that perceived partner responsiveness led people to adopt a broader perspective. Together, these studies point to perceptions of responsiveness and unresponsiveness as one factor that lessens and intensifies, respectively, openness and non-defensiveness.},

The aim of the current experiment was to examine this question in a between-subjects design. A total of 111 healthy participants were randomly assigned to an anxious, positive, or neutral multimodal mood induction after which they performed the established semantic coherence task. This task operationalizes intuition as the sudden, inexplicable detection of environmental coherence, based on automatic, unconscious processes of spreading activation. The current findings show that anxious participants showed impaired intuitive performance compared to participants of the positive and neutral mood groups. Trait anxiety did not moderate this effect. Accordingly, holistic, associative processes seem to be impaired by anxiety. Clinical implications and directions for future research are discussed.},

Most researchers, however, have focused on unidimensional rather than multidimensional conceptualizations of self-esteem. The paucity of empirical research is surprising given conflicting theoretical perspectives on the stability of self-esteem. The goal of the present study was to thoroughly disentangle different conceptualizations of self-esteem and test opposing classical theories on (i) the stability and (ii) the direction of mutual influence of these different forms of self-esteem. We analysed two-year longitudinal data from participants (N = 644 at T1, N = 241 at T2) with an average age of 47.0 years (SD = 12.4). Analyses using a latent variable approach revealed that the domains of self-esteem were relatively stable in terms of rank order and mean levels. In fact, the size of the stability coefficients was comparable to that of other trait measures that have been reported in the literature and paralleled the stability observed for global self-esteem. Results did not provide support for either top-down or bottom-up effects between domain-specific and global self-esteem. These findings have important theoretical and practical implications regarding the stability and development of self-esteem in adulthood and advance the understanding of self-esteem in personality theory. \textcopyright{} 2018 European Association of Personality Psychology},

  abstract = {Our ability to stay focused is limited: prolonged performance of a task typically results in mental fatigue and decrements in performance over time. This so-called vigilance decrement has been attributed to depletion of attentional resources, though other factors such as reductions in motivation likely also play a role. In this study, we examined three electroencephalography (EEG) markers of attentional control, to elucidate which stage of attentional processing is most affected by time-on-task and motivation. To elicit the vigilance decrement, participants performed a sustained attention task for 80~min without breaks. After 60~min, participants were motivated by an unexpected monetary incentive to increase performance in the final 20~min. We found that task performance and self-reported motivation declined rapidly, reaching stable levels well before the motivation manipulation was introduced. Thereafter, motivation increased back up to the initial level, and remained there for the final 20~min. While task performance also increased, it did not return to the initial level, and fell to the lowest level overall during the final 10~min. This pattern of performance changes was mirrored by the trial-to-trial consistency of the phase of theta (3\textendash 7~Hz) oscillations, an index of the variability in timing of the neural response to the stimulus. As task performance decreased, temporal variability increased, suggesting that attentional stability is crucial for sustained attention performance. The effects of attention on our two other EEG measures\textemdash early P1/N1 event-related potentials (ERPs) and pre-stimulus alpha (9\textendash 14~Hz) power\textemdash did not change with time-on-task or motivation. In sum, these findings show that the vigilance decrement is accompanied by a decline in only some facets of attentional control, which cannot be fully brought back online by increases in motivation. The vigilance decrement might thus not occur due to a single cause, but is likely multifactorial in origin.},

Content support was found to lead to less pausing, more revision, and increased linguistic complexity. When content support was absent, more frequent pauses and revisions were associated with less sophisticated lexis.

However, the specific predictors and mechanisms of this form of female intrasexual competition are less well understood. We propose that one mechanism by which women harm rivals' social opportunities is through selectively transmitting reputation-relevant social information. Moreover, we contend that this behavior is designed to undermine the romantic and social appeal of same-sex romantic rivals who are perceived to be threatening. Evidence from five studies suggests that women's dissemination of social information is strategic and reliably predicted by various cues of romantic rival threat: attempts at mate poaching (Study 1), physical attractiveness (Studies 2 and 3), and provocative clothing (Studies 4 and 5). Women strategically harmed and failed to enhance the reputations of other women who threatened their romantic prospects directly (by flirting with their romantic partners) and indirectly (by being attractive or provocatively dressed). Women's dispositional levels of competitiveness also predicted their information transmission: highly competitive women (both generally and in romantic domains specifically) disclosed more reputation-damaging information than did less competitive women. Furthermore, women transmitted reputation-harming information about female targets independent of how much they explicitly liked those targets, suggesting a disconnect between women's intentions and their gossip behavior. Irrespective of the gossiper's intentions, pilot data confirmed that social harm is likely to befall the women targeted by the transmission of reputation-damaging social information.},

The current study represents a meta-analysis conducted to evaluate the direction and magnitude of the association of intelligence with global psychopathy, as well as its factors and facets, and related disorders (i.e. antisocial personality disorder, conduct disorder, and oppositional defiant disorder). Our analyses revealed a small, significant, negative relationship between intelligence and total psychopathy (r = -.07, p = .001). Analysis of factors and facets found differential associations, including both significant positive (e.g. interpersonal facet) and negative (e.g. affective facet) associations, further affirming that psychopathy is a multidimensional construct. Additionally, intelligence was negatively associated with antisocial personality disorder (r = -.13, p = .001) and conduct disorder (r = -.13, p = .001) but positively with oppositional defiant disorder (r = .06, p = .001). There was significant heterogeneity across studies for most effects, but the results of moderator analyses were inconsistent.

While several lines of research provide evidence for grounding of action-related conceptual content into sensory-motor systems, results of traditional lesion-deficit studies have been somewhat inconsistent. Further, few studies have directly compared the neural substrates of action and relatively abstract verb comprehension post-stroke. Here, we investigated the impact of the disruption of two neural networks on comprehension of action and relatively abstract verbs in 48 unilateral left-hemisphere stroke patients using two methodologies: 1) lesion-deficit association and 2) resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) analyses. Disruption of RSFC between the left inferior frontal gyrus and right hemisphere primary and secondary sensory-motor areas predicted greater relative impairment of action semantics. Voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping revealed that damage to frontal white matter, extending towards the inferior frontal gyrus, also predicted greater relative impairment of action semantics. On the other hand, damage to the left anterior middle temporal gyrus significantly impaired the more abstract category relative to action. These findings support the view that action and non-action/abstract semantic processing rely on partially dissociable brain networks, with action concepts relying more heavily on sensory-motor areas. The results also have wider implications for lesion-deficit association studies and show how the contralateral hemisphere can play a compensatory role following unilateral stroke.},

  abstract = {The presence of Anglian and Anglo-Scandinavian settlements at Cottam, East Yorkshire, was first indicated in 1987 by numerous finds of copper alloy coins, dress pins and strap ends by metal detector users. This report presents the results of fieldwork carried out on behalf of the Department of Archaeology, University of York, between 1993-5, including field walking, geophysical survey, and excavation. This revealed an enclosure of the eighth-ninth centuries, containing traces of a small number of post-built halls. In the late ninth century this settlement was then abandoned, a process which led to the incorporation of a human female skull in a domestic rubbish pit. A new enclosed settlement was laid out nearby, which was occupied briefly in the early tenth century. It is argued that the Anglian settlement may have been part of a royal multiple estate but that as a result of estate reorganisation after the Scandinavian settlement it developed into an independent manor. Cottam is the first so-called 'productive site' in the environs of York to be the subject of archaeological investigations. The results suggest that it was a prosperous but not exceptional site, and that the primary activity was farming, with limited evidence for trade or manufacture. This work also prompts a reassessment of the typology of crop mark enclosures and the re-examination of the large number of undated enclosures in the area.},

There are now thousands more artefacts and coins known than a decade ago which, in conjunction with fieldwork, have the potential to revolutionise our understanding of the early medieval period. This is the first time that these data have been examined on a national scale. Such an approach enables the detailed analysis of the nature of portable antiquities data, the bias within such datasets and the relationship between patterns of recovery and historic settlement (Sections 2 and 3). In the light of these new interpretations of the overall datasets, the most artefact- and coin-rich sites, known as 'productive sites', can be analysed within a new framework of understanding (Section 4). This article is a major outcome of the Viking and Anglo-Saxon Landscape and Economy (VASLE) project, funded by AHRC research grant APN18370. In addition to the narrative elements of the article, readers are able to access the original datasets to draw their own maps, and to call up charts of the artefact assemblages for over 60 'productive sites'.

  abstract = {Syntactic abilities vary across individuals. Weak syntax is typically ascribed to limited competence (knowledge) or poor performance (processing). However, with many questioning this dichotomy, alternative explanations should be considered. Arguments related to language exposure are insufficient because language-impaired children often have good input. An alternative account, the learning hypothesis, assumes that individual variation in syntactic abilities reflects variation in construction-learning ability. To evaluate this claim, we tested construction learning in 49 5-year-old English-speaking children, targeting two complex constructions rarely attested in child-directed speech, though with no control of prior exposure. The results revealed that there was substantial variation in the children's construction-learning ability, which was strongly associated with their performance on static standardized language assessments (the Test of Reception of Grammar and the Renfrew Action Picture Task) and that nonadjacent open slots were problematic. While our findings supported the learning hypothesis, further research should determine causes of individual variation in syntactic ability.

Vision provides key information about one's own self-motion as well as the motions of other people in the crowd. These two types of information (optic flow and biological motion) have each been investigated extensively; however, surprisingly little research has been dedicated to investigating how they are processed when presented concurrently. Here, we showed that patterns of biological motion have a negative impact on visualheading estimation when people within the crowd move their limbs but do not move through the scene. Conversely, limb motion facilitates heading estimation when walkers move independently through the scene. Interestingly, this facilitation occurs for crowds containing both regular and perturbed depictions of humans, suggesting that it is likely caused by low-level motion cues inherent in the biological motion of other people.},

Current interpretations of this post-boundary preview difficulty effect range from delayed parafoveal-on-foveal effects in parallel word-processing models to forced fixations in serial word-processing models. However, these findings are based on an experimental design that, while allowing to isolate preview difficulty effects, might have established a bias with respect to asymmetries in parafoveal preview benefit for high-frequent and low-frequent target words. Here, we present a revision of this paradigm varying the preview's lexical frequency and keeping the target word constant. We found substantial effects of the preview difficulty in fixation durations after the boundary confirming that preview processing affects the oculomotor decisions not only via trans-saccadic integration of preview and target word information. An additional time-course analysis showed that the preview difficulty effect was significant across the full fixation duration distribution on the target word without any evidence on the pretarget word before the boundary. We discuss implications of the accumulating evidence of post-boundary preview difficulty effects for models of eye movement control during reading.},

Across 142 effect sizes from 42 data sets involving over 600,000 participants, we found consistent evidence for beneficial effects of education on cognitive abilities of approximately 1 to 5 IQ points for an additional year of education. Moderator analyses indicated that the effects persisted across the life span and were present on all broad categories of cognitive ability studied. Education appears to be the most consistent, robust, and durable method yet to be identified for raising intelligence.},

Participants who made RCJs prior to their restudy decisions were more accurate at identifying items in need of being restudied, relative to participants who made JOLs. The results indicate that having participants assess their confidence in past retrieval success can nudge them toward better utilizing of valid information when deciding which items are in need of further study.},

We used a novel quantitative linguistic approach in conjunction with controlled laboratory experiments and real-world data. This work revealed that the intent to persuade other people spontaneously increases the emotionality of individuals' appeals via the words they use. Furthermore, in a preregistered experiment, the association between emotion and persuasion appeared sufficiently strong that people persisted in the use of more emotional appeals even when such appeals might backfire. Finally, direct evidence was provided for an association in memory between persuasion and emotionality.},

Study 1 was a field experiment conducted among primary and middle school teachers who, respectively, expected positive versus negative outcomes from an actual major education change in Poland. We manipulated message framing, describing the prospected change in a promotion-related or prevention-related way. We measured processing fluency, engagement, process fairness, and change openness. Study 2 was a vignette experiment where college graduates assessed their openness to a change in university policy regarding credits for research participation. We randomized change framing (promotion vs. prevention) and outcome (positive vs. negative) between the participants. Supporting the predictions, the decision process regarding the change was perceived as more fair when the message framing matched recipients' regulatory focus. In line with our expectations, perceived fairness was linked with increased openness towards the change especially among individuals who could be hurt by the changes. In both studies, the fairness mechanism was crucial under these circumstances as compared to the competing mechanism of engagement (and fluency in Study 1).},

Previously, we found that genetic ablation of Fzr1 promotes the death of neural progenitor cells leading to neurogenesis impairment and microcephaly in mouse. To ascertain the possible translation of these findings in humans, we searched for mutations in the Fzr1 gene in 390 whole exomes sequenced in trio in individuals showing neurodevelopmental disorders compatible with a genetic origin. We found a novel missense (p.Asp187Gly) Fzr1 gene mutation (c.560A{$>$}G) in a heterozygous state in a 4-year-old boy, born from non-consanguineous Spanish parents, who presents with severe antenatal microcephaly, psychomotor retardation, and refractory epilepsy. Cdh1 protein levels in leucocytes isolated from the patient were significantly lower than those found in his parents. Expression of the Asp187Gly mutant form of Cdh1 in human embryonic kidney 293T cells produced less Cdh1 protein and APC/C activity, resulting in altered cell cycle distribution when compared with cells expressing wild-type Cdh1. Furthermore, ectopic expression of the Asp187Gly mutant form of Cdh1 in cortical progenitor cells in primary culture failed to abolish the enlargement of the replicative phase caused by knockout of endogenous Cdh1. These results indicate that the loss of function of APC/C-Cdh1 caused by Cdh1 Asp187Gly mutation is a new cause of prenatal microcephaly, psychomotor retardation, and severe epilepsy.

We examined such discouragement by peer excellence by exploiting the incidental exposure to peers' abilities that occurs when students are asked to assess each other's work.

Exposure to exemplary peer performances caused a large proportion of students to quit the course. Study 2 explored underlying psychological mechanisms in an online replication (N = 361).

We showed that cue-based reminders are more potent when the cues they employ are distinctive relative to (a) other regularly encountered stimuli and (b) other stimuli encountered concurrently. Further, they can be more effective than written or electronic reminder messages, and they are undervalued and underused. The reminders-through-association approach, developed by integrating and expanding on past research on self-control, reminders, and prospective memory, can be a powerful tool for policymakers and individuals.},

Although specification-curve analysis clearly confirmed the previously reported birth-order effect on intellect, we found no meaningful effects on life satisfaction, locus of control, interpersonal trust, reciprocity, risk taking, patience, impulsivity, or political orientation.

In this study, respondents from a representative German sample reported, in text format, ideas for how they could improve their life satisfaction. We investigated which of these ideas predicted changes in life satisfaction 1 year later. Active pursuits per se\textemdash as opposed to statements about external circumstances or fortune\textemdash were not associated with changes in life satisfaction (n = 1,178). However, in line with our preregistered hypothesis, among individuals who described active pursuits (n = 582), those who described social ideas (e.g., spending more time with friends and family) ended up being more satisfied, and this effect was partly mediated by increased socializing. Our results demonstrate that not all pursuits of happiness are equally successful and corroborate the great importance of social relationships for human well-being.},

Although we found that people both reciprocate and conform, reciprocity has a stronger influence on cooperation.

Studying the cognitive processes underlying cooperative behavior in apes, our closest living relatives, can help identify these mechanisms. Accordingly, we employed a novel test battery to assess the willingness of 40 chimpanzees to donate resources, instrumentally help others, and punish a culpable thief. We found that chimpanzees were faster to make prosocial than selfish choices and that more prosocial individuals made the fastest responses. Further, two measures of self-control did not predict variation in prosocial responding, and individual performance across cooperative tasks did not covary. These results show that chimpanzees and humans share key cognitive processes for cooperation, despite differences in the scope of their cooperative behaviors.},

  abstract = {Ego depletion is a state in which people prefer to avoid mental effort, therefore possibly leading to increased reliance on heuristics. Effortful thinking has been shown to help reduce anchoring effects, in which people form social judgments by adjusting from an initial value (the anchor). We therefore predicted that ego depletion would reduce the amount of adjustment from an initial anchor, leaving the final judgment relatively close to the anchor value. In contrast to previous research by Banker et al. (2017), we excluded alternative explanations, such as social mechanisms. In particular, we tested adjustment from internally generated and externally provided anchors. We theorized that judgment adjustment processes are the same for both internal and external cues. The results showed that neither self-generated nor experimenter-provided anchors were affected by ego depletion, thus leaving social mechanisms as the prime alternative explanation. The data also showed that susceptibility to anchoring is not a trait because reactions to different anchors were not substantially intercorrelated. Further, providing externally or internally generated anchors did not make a fundamental difference. However, the loss of data was higher with self-generated anchors. Overall, the results suggest that researchers can confidently rely on experimenter-generated anchors.},

Contrary to conventional wisdom that citizens are passive consumers of propaganda, I show that they extract objective economic information from personal experience and local conditions. Moreover, I find that they give greater weight to this information where regional party dominance makes economic performance a clearer indicator of the ruling party's competence and when they believe the media are biased.

In three studies, adults (N = 426) made moral evaluations of harm and purity transgressions that systematically varied in dosage (frequency or magnitude). Pairs of low-dosage and high-dosage transgressions were presented such that the same sets of modifiers (e.g., ``occasionally'' vs. ``regularly,'' ``small'' vs. ``large'') or amounts (e.g., ``millimeter'' vs. ``centimeter'') were reused across moral domains. Statistical interactions between domain and dosage indicated robust distinctions between the perceived wrongness of high-dosage and low-dosage harms, whereas moral evaluations of impure acts were considerably less influenced by dosage. Our findings support the existence of a cognitive distinction between purity-based and harm-based morals and challenge current wisdom regarding relationships between intentions and outcomes in moral judgment.},

Social psychology typically follows a tradition in which many participants perform a small number of trials each; in psychophysics, the tradition is to include only a few participants, who perform many trials each; and the tradition in cognitive psychology falls in between, balancing the number of participants and trials. We ask whether it is better to add trials or to add participants if one wishes to increase power. The answer is straightforward\textemdash greatest power is achieved by using more people, and the gain from adding people is greater than the gain from adding trials. In light of these results, the design parameters in the social psychology tradition seem ideal. Yet there are conditions in which one may trade people for trials with only a minor decrement in power. Under these conditions, the limiting factor is the trial-to-trial variability rather than the variability across people in the population. These conditions are highly plausible, and we present a theoretical argument as to why. We think that most cognitive effects are characterized by stochastic dominance; that is, everyone's true effect is in the same direction. For example, it is plausible that when performing the Stroop task, all people truly identify congruent colors faster than incongruent ones. When dominance holds, small mean effects imply a small degree of variability across the population. It is this degree of homogeneity, the consequence of dominance, that licenses the design parameters of the cognitive psychology and psychophysics traditions.},

Recent work, however, downplayed the role of sensorimotor information in producing approach/avoidance compatibility effects (i.e., faster response times to approach positive stimuli and avoid negative stimuli, than the reverse). We suggest that this is likely due to an overemphasis of the role of motor aspects of arm movement in these effects. The goal of this research is therefore to reevaluate the role of sensorimotor information in the production of compatibility effects by suggesting that large and replicable effects can be observed when the task simulates the visual information that comes with whole-body movements. In line with this idea, we present six experiments showing that such a task (the Visual Approach/Avoidance by the Self Task; VAAST) can produce large and replicable compatibility effects. Importantly, these experiments also test the core aspects producing these effects. These experiments reassert the role of sensorimotor information in the production of approach/avoidance compatibility effects. This entails, however, focusing on the visual information associated with whole-body movements instead of motor aspects associated with arm movements.},

Study 1 investigated whether variation in the diagnosticity of individuating information moderated stereotype bias in implicit and explicit person perception.

Studies 2 and 3 examined the effects on person perception of racial stereotypes and of diagnostic individuating information that varied in valence. Study 2 found no substantial implicit or explicit anti-Black stereotype bias in the presence of diagnostic individuating information and large individuating information effects on explicit person perception. Study 3 found no explicit anti-Black stereotype bias in the presence of diagnostic individuating information and that individuating information influenced both implicit and explicit person perception. Together, these studies showed that individuating information can reduce or eliminate stereotype bias in implicit and explicit person perception and that its effect depends on the diagnosticity of the information.

  abstract = {Neural oscillations in the low frequencies, roughly in the alpha band ({$\alpha$}, 5\textendash 15~Hz), have been suggested to act as a gateway from sensation to perception. This hypothesis assumes discrete perception. In particular, the amplitude and the phase of the low frequency rhythm entails a cortical mechanism which paces the access of sensory information into the cognitive system. Evidence supporting this idea includes correlations between the phase of neural oscillations and behavioral performance in perception, spatial attention and working memory. Despite a widespread confidence in the theory, these findings have been mostly based on a varied range of exploratory approaches and inferential group statistics. Here, we aimed at validating the involvement of low frequency cortical rhythm in perception and at providing a clear-cut EEG analysis pipeline. Such an analytical pipeline should support the adoption of a hypothesis-driven framework for future replications and applications. The design, the analyses and the statistical power of the present experiment were based on prior studies in which phase opposition was successfully found. However, our results provide evidence for the involvement of pre-stimulus oscillatory alpha amplitude but not phase in perception. We discuss the null findings from the present study within the existing literature.},

Incremental-induced participants blamed a person showing consistently maladaptive levels of the trait more than did entity-induced participants. Increased blame was mediated by increased perceived control over behavior. Study 3 (N=107) extended findings regarding lay theories of empathy to protagonists in short narratives. Study 4 (N=184) attempted to reconcile our findings with previous research, showing that increased blame attribution by incremental theorists occurs for continual, but not single failures. Overall results suggest that the benefits of an incremental mindset may be partially offset by greater judgmental harshness of others.},

  abstract = {Intergroup trust is vital for cooperation and societal well-being, but is harder to establish than interpersonal trust. We investigate whether expressions of negative emotions, in particular regret, following economic decisions can shape intergroup trust. In each of three studies participants were members of a group playing a two-round trust game with another group. In the first round, they observed an outgroup member who acted fairly or unfairly towards the ingroup and then expressed positive (i.e., happiness) or negative (i.e., regret, unhappiness) emotions about this behavior. In the second round, participants played with another outgroup member. Emotions displayed by the outgroup representative following unfair behavior in round 1 influenced participants' allocations in round 2, which were higher following regret and unhappiness than following positive emotions. Thus, emotions expressed by one outgroup member affected interactions with other members who had not communicated emotions. Findings of Study 3 revealed that these effects were driven by regret increasing intergroup trust, rather than by happiness decreasing it. Moreover, participants' allocations were predicted by their perceptions of the extent to which the outgroup representative wished to change her behavior. Together, the findings reveal that regret expressions influence intergroup trust by attenuating the detrimental effects of unfair behavior.},

  abstract = {Abstract Visual information is detected by the retina and transmitted into the brain by retinal ganglion cells. In rodents, the visual thalamus is a major recipient of retinal ganglion cells axons and is divided into three functionally distinct nuclei: the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN), ventral LGN (vLGN), and intergeniculate leaflet. Despite being densely innervated by retinal input, each nucleus in rodent visual thalamus possesses diverse molecular profiles which underpin their unique circuitry and cytoarchitecture. Here, we combined large-scale unbiased proteomic and transcriptomic analyses to elucidate the molecular expression profiles of the developing mouse dLGN and vLGN. We identified several extracellular matrix proteins as differentially expressed in these regions, particularly constituent molecules of perineuronal nets (PNNs). Remarkably, we discovered at least two types of molecularly distinct Aggrecan-rich PNN populations in vLGN, exhibiting non-overlapping spatial, temporal, and cell-type specific expression patterns. The mechanisms responsible for the formation of these two populations of PNNs also differ as the formation of Cat315+ PNNs (but not WFA+ PNNs) required input from the retina. This study is first to suggest that cell type- and molecularly specific supramolecular assemblies of extracellular matrix may play important roles in the circuitry associated with the subcortical visual system and in the processing of visual information.

  abstract = {For decades, there has been controversy about whether forgetting is caused by decay over time or by interference from irrelevant information. We suggest that forgetting occurs because of decay or interference, depending on the memory representation. Recollection-based memories, supported by the hippocampus, are represented in orthogonal patterns and are therefore relatively resistant to interference from one another. Decay should be a major source of their forgetting. By contrast, familiarity-based memories, supported by extrahippocampal structures, are not represented in orthogonal patterns and are therefore sensitive to interference. In a study in which we manipulated the postencoding task-interference level and the length of the delay between study and testing, we provide direct evidence in support of our representation theory of forgetting. Recollection and familiarity were measured using the remember/know procedure. We show that the causes of forgetting depend on the nature of the underlying memory representation, which places the century-old puzzle of forgetting in a coherent framework.},

  abstract = {Students regularly engage in self-evaluations by comparing their performance to their peers' performance (Strickhouser \& Zell, 2015), which may influence their feelings about themselves and willingness to persist in college. Because failure is a natural component of learning, it is important to examine how to promote students' development when performance is weak relative to their peers. The current study examined if self-compassion moderates the impact of social comparisons on students' self-evaluations and affect across two domains relevant to college life: academic and interpersonal competence. Students (N = 245) completed a test of academic or interpersonal skills and then received either no feedback or false feedback reporting their performance as below average, average, or above average relative to peers. Participants then completed measures of self-evaluation, affect, and self-compassion. In the academic, F(4,103) = 9.20, p {$<$} .001, R2 = .26, p {$<$} .001, and interpersonal, F(4,105) = 14.88, p {$<$} .001, R2 = .36, p {$<$} .001, domains, participants reported more negative affect (but not self-evaluations) when performance was below average compared to average, above average, or when no feedback was given. Self-compassion was associated with more positive affect, {$\beta$}s {$>$} .25, p {$<$} .001, and less negative affect, {$\beta$}s {$<$} -.28, p {$<$} .001, in both domains, with the impact of self-compassion in the interpersonal domain particularly important for positive affect, F(7, 102) = 13.74, {$\Delta$}R2 = .15, p {$<$} .001, when performance was average or above average. Increasing students' self-compassion shows potential for shaping their reactions to social comparisons.},

Results indicated that the participants generally enhanced the global comprehensibility of their speech (through reducing vowel insertion errors in complex syllables) as a function of increased classroom experience during their first semester, and explicit learning aptitude (associative memory, phonemic coding) appeared to help certain learners further enhance their pronunciation proficiency through the development of fluency and prosody. In the second semester, incidental learning ability (sound sequence recognition) was shown to be a significant predictor of the extent to which certain learners continued to improve and ultimately attain advanced-level L2 comprehensibility, largely thanks to improved segmental accuracy.},

Adopting this model (Framework for L2 Pronunciation Measurement) as a synthetic tool, we coded the instruments found in 77 studies of L2 pronunciation teaching published between 1982 and 2017. We calculated the frequency of each measurement type and reexamined the interaction of instructional effectiveness and measurement within the sample. According to the results, instruction is most effective when it targets learners' monitored production of specific segmental or suprasegmental features. The efficacy of instruction remains relatively unclear when gains are measured globally via subjective, human judgments, especially at a spontaneous level.

Students' anxiety together with weaker Ideal L2 Self related negatively to their performance at the beginning of the project\textemdash performance that they had achieved after several years of EFL instruction. Students' enjoyment together with greater Ideal L2 Self predicted the extent to which they practiced and developed their L2 speech within the 3-month framework of the project.

  abstract = {N-methyl-d-Aspartate receptors (NMDARs) are abundant postsynaptic proteins that are critical for normal synaptic communication. NMDAR channel function is regulated by multiple properties, including phosphorylation. Inhibition of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) in hippocampal neurons increases NMDAR activity, an effect abrogated by loss of spinophilin, the major PP1-targeting protein in the postsynaptic density. However, how spinophilin regulates PP1-dependent NMDAR function is unclear. We hypothesize that spinophilin regulates PP1 binding to the NMDAR to alter NMDAR phosphorylation. Our data demonstrate that spinophilin interacts with the GluN2B subunit of the NMDAR. In human embryonic kidney 293 FT cells, activation and/or overexpression of protein kinase A increased the association between spinophilin and the GluN2B subunit of the NMDAR. Functionally, we found that spinophilin overexpression decreased PP1 binding to the GluN2B subunit of the NMDAR and attenuated the PP1-dependent dephosphorylation of GluN2B at Ser-1284. Moreover, in P28 hippocampal lysates isolated from spinophilin KO compared to WT mice, there was increased binding of GluN2B to PP1, decreased phosphorylation of GluN2B at Ser-1284, and altered GluN2B protein interactions with postsynaptic density-enriched proteins. Together, our data demonstrate that spinophilin decreases PP1 binding to GluN2B and concomitantly enhances the phosphorylation of GluN2B at Ser-1284. The putative consequences of these spinophilin-dependent alterations in GluN2B phosphorylation and interactions on synaptic GluN2B localization and function are discussed.

This article focuses on criminal violence and proposes a twofold mechanism to explain why peacekeeping missions, even when effectively reducing conflict, can inadvertently increase criminal violence. First, less conflict opens up economic opportunities (so-called peacekeeping economies) and provides operational security for organized crime, thus increasing violent competition among criminal groups. Second, demobilized combatants are vulnerable to turn to crime because of limited legal livelihood opportunities and their training in warfare. While UN troops may exacerbate these dynamics, UN police's peculiar role is likely to successfully contain criminal violence. Cross-national and subnational empirical analyses show that large UN military deployments result in higher homicide rates, whereas UN police, overall, moderate this collateral effect.},

While most stigma researchers assume that there is a direct correspondence between the attitude of prejudiced individuals and the targets (i.e., sexism affects women, racism affects racial minorities), the five studies reported here demonstrate that White women can be threatened by racism (Study 1, 3, 4, and 5) and men of color by sexism (Study 2). Robust to perceptions of liking and the order in which measures were administered, results showed that prejudice transfers between racism and sexism were driven by the presumed social dominance orientation of the prejudiced individual. In addition, important downstream consequences, such as the increased likelihood of anticipated stigma, expectations of unfair treatment, and the attribution of negative feedback to sexism, appeared for stigmatized individuals.},

This question is relevant given that many studies suggest that the objective meaning of invisible stimuli can influence cognitive processes and behavior. In an experiment involving 66 participants, we tested how the perceived meaning of misperceived stimuli influenced response times. Stroop priming (i.e., longer response times for incongruent than for congruent prime-target pairs) was observed in trials in which the prime was correctly identified. However, reversed Stroop priming was observed when the prime stimulus was incorrectly identified. Even in trials in which participants reported no perception of the prime and identified the primes at close to chance level (i.e., trials that meet both subjective and objective definitions of being subliminal), Stroop priming corresponded to perceived congruency, not objective congruency. This result suggests that occasional weak percepts and mispercepts are intermixed with no percepts in conditions traditionally claimed to be subliminal, casting doubt on claims of subliminal priming made in previous reports.},

Four studies (and an internal meta-analysis) tested the idea that receiving a generous gift from someone higher in perceived socioeconomic status (SES) signals social identity threat. In Study 1 (N = 218), participants on average, but especially those with relatively lower SES, reported experiencing more self-conscious negative affect when receiving a generous amount of money (vs. an even split) from a higher status giver in a dictator game. This effect was mediated by feeling pitied by the giver. Studies 2 (N = 331) and 3 (N = 426) revealed similar effects with recalled real-world experiences of receiving a generous gift from higher SES givers. Studies 3 and 4 (N = 142) revealed evidence for serial mediation, with lower relative SES predicting status awareness, status awareness predicting attributions of pity, and attributions of pity in turn predicting self-conscious negative affect. Effects were not significantly moderated by needing or requesting the money, suggesting that acts of generosity across the status divide readily signal social devaluation for those with lower perceived status. Findings have practical and conceptual implications for prosocial giving in a system of social and economic inequality.},

The results showed that perceived practical and linguistic values related to pronunciation learning led students to be concerned about their pronunciation and thus increased their intentional behavior to improve their pronunciation skills. Also, the greater the intentional behavior, the more likely students were to select strategies to advance their pronunciation skills. Furthermore, a multigroup SEM analysis revealed that self?efficacy about pronunciation skills significantly influenced girls? emotions, whereas self?efficacy had a negligible effect on boys? emotions.

Given that researchers might need to compensate for these higher costs, we hypothesized that larger sample sizes might have been accompanied by more frequent use of less costly research methods (i.e., online data collection and self-report measures). To test this idea, we analyzed social psychology studies published in 2009, 2011, 2016, and 2018.

This is the methodological solution to concerns about standardisation, sample size and experimental control. However, there is little work investigating the robustness of these first impressions through to first interactions. A sample of 97 pairs of stranger participants (N = 194) completed personality measures (Big Five and Triarchic Model of Psychopathy), made personality and social judgments of a photograph of the face of their to-be partner, then engaged in 5 min (maximum) of unstructured interaction with their partner and then made their judgments again. The behaviour of the participants in the interaction was coded using 76 criteria by 13 trained coders. Results showed that, judgments made before and after interaction were correlated, but different. Personality judgment accuracy at Time 1 was poor overall but improved at Time 2 participants for Neuroticism, Extraversion and psychopathic Boldness. Coded behaviours related to `engagement' were those that influenced the person judgments the most, and these were related to Extraversion, Agreeableness and Boldness of participants. Overall, the results of this study show that first impressions of personality change from photographs to face-to-face interaction. Person judgment research should be aware of the extent to which judgments of photographs relate to first interaction.},

  abstract = {Abstract In the central nervous system, astrocytes extend endfoot processes to ensheath synapses and microvessels. However, the mechanisms underlying this astrocytic process extension remain unclear. A limitation of the use of 2D cultured astrocytes for such studies is that they display a flat, epithelioid morphology, with no or very few processes, which is markedly different from the stellate morphology observed in~vivo. In this study, we obtained 2D cultured astrocytes with a rich complexity of processes using differentiation of neurospheres in~vitro. Using these process-bearing astrocytes, we showed that laminin, an extracellular matrix molecule abundant in perivascular sites, efficiently induced process formation and branching. Specifically, the numbers of the first- and second-order branch processes and the maximal process length of astrocytes were increased when cultured on laminin, compared with when they were cultured on poly-L-ornithine or type IV collagen. Knockdown of dystroglycan or {$\alpha$}-syntrophin, constituent proteins of the dystrophin?glycoprotein complex that provides a link between laminin and the cytoskeleton, using small interference RNAs inhibited astrocyte process formation and branching, and down-regulated expression of the water channel aquaporin-4 (AQP4). Direct knockdown and a specific inhibitor of AQP4 also inhibited, whereas over-expression of AQP4 enhanced astrocyte process formation and branching. Knockdown of AQP4 decreased phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) that is critically implicated in actin remodeling. Collectively, these results indicate that the laminin?dystroglycan?{$\alpha$}-syntrophin?AQP4 axis is important for process formation and branching of 2D cultured astrocytes.

Specifically, we show that using an offer framing strategy that shifts offer recipients' attention to their reservation price (e.g., ``How does my offer compare to your minimum price?'') leads to both (a) an assimilation effect whereby recipients make more favorable counteroffers (economic benefit) as well as (b) a contrast effect whereby recipients feel more satisfied with the negotiation (relational benefit). We find evidence for the effectiveness of this conversational strategy across four experiments (N~=~1522) involving different negotiation contexts (real estate, restaurant sale) and participant samples (MBAs, sales agents, online participants), and also document negotiator power as an important boundary condition. Overall, our research suggests that economic and relational benefits do not have to be mutually exclusive in distributive negotiations, that the perceived extremity of an offer is subjective and can be strategically influenced, and that assimilation and contrast effects can operate simultaneously when they relate to separate outcomes.},

  abstract = {Abstract The main pathophysiological alterations of Alzheimer's disease (AD) include loss of neuronal and synaptic integrity, amyloidogenic processing, and neuroinflammation. Similar alterations can, however, also be observed in cognitively intact older subjects and may prelude the clinical manifestation of AD. The objectives of this prospective cross-sectional study in a cohort of 38 cognitively intact older adults were twofold: (i) to investigate the latent relationship among cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers reflecting the main pathophysiological processes of AD, and (ii) to assess the correlation between these biomarkers and gray matter volume as well as amyloid load. All subjects underwent extensive neuropsychological examinations, CSF sampling, [18F]-flutemetamol amyloid positron emission tomography, and T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. A factor analysis revealed one factor that explained most of the variance in the CSF biomarker dataset clustering t-tau, {$\alpha$}-synuclein, p-tau181, neurogranin, BACE1, visinin-like protein 1, chitinase-3-like protein 1 (YKL-40), A?1?40 and A?1?38. Higher scores on this factor correlated with lower gray matter volume and with higher amyloid load in the precuneus. At the level of individual CSF biomarkers, levels of visinin-like protein 1, neurogranin, BACE1, A?1?40, A?1?38, and YKL-40 all correlated inversely with gray matter volume of the precuneus. These findings demonstrate that in cognitively intact older subjects, CSF levels of synaptic and neuronal integrity biomarkers, amyloidogenic processing and measures of innate immunity (YKL-40) display a latent structure of common variance, which is associated with loss of structural integrity of brain regions implicated in the earliest stages of AD.

  abstract = {At the end of a diet, even a successful one, people often return to overeating. One potential reason is that the behavioral inhibition that people learn while dieting might not readily transfer outside the context in which it is learned: Basic research indicates that after a behavior is inhibited, a return to the conditioning context or simple removal from the treatment context can cause the behavior to return (i.e., to renew). Can states of hunger and satiety play the role of context? In two experiments, rats learned a food-seeking response that earned sucrose or sweet, fatty food pellets while they were satiated. Responding was then inhibited (i.e., extinguished) while the rats were hungry. On the rats' return to the satiated state, their food seeking was renewed. Additional results suggest that associations with hunger or satiety stimuli were learned more readily than associations with other potentially useful exteroceptive stimuli. The findings have implications for understanding the role of interoceptive contexts in controlling the inhibition of motivated behavior.},

In Experiment 1, we replicated previously observed construction-dependent crosslinguistic differences between French and German and provided new data for Spanish. In Experiment 2, we assessed offline and online interpretation preferences of intermediate L1 French and L1 Spanish learners of German. Our results provide evidence of form-dependent L1 influence, in that learners transferred a generalized antecedent bias associated with overt pronouns. Moreover, our results extend previous findings by showing that L1 influence on L2 pronoun resolution can occur during online processing.

For instance, in the colour-word Stroop paradigm, participants respond slower and less accurately to the print colour of incongruent colour words (e.g., ``red'' printed in green) than to congruent colour words (e.g., ``green'' in green). Importantly, this congruency effect is diminished when the trials in an experiment are mostly incongruent, relative to mostly congruent, termed a proportion congruent effect. When distracting stimuli are mostly congruent in one context (e.g., location or font) but mostly incongruent in another context (e.g., another location or font), the congruency effect is still diminished in the mostly incongruent context, termed a context-specific proportion congruent (CSPC) effect. Both the standard proportion congruent and CSPC effects are typically interpreted in terms of conflict-driven attentional control, frequently termed conflict adaptation or conflict monitoring. However, in two experiments, we investigated contingency learning confounds in context-specific proportion congruent effects. In particular, two variants of a dissociation procedure are presented with the font variant of the CSPC procedure. In both, robust contingency learning effects were observed. No evidence for context-specific control was observed. In fact, results trended in the wrong direction. In all, the results suggest that CSPC effects may not be a useful way of studying attentional control.},

However, this relationship has not been analysed while accounting for the complex structure of conscientiousness and the multifaceted conception of grit (perseverance of effort; consistency of interest). In this study, we analysed the connection while considering the hierarchical structure of conscientiousness, differentiating between a superordinate factor, a first-level common factor (industriousness), and lower level unique factors. Drawing on two samples (N = 413, Mage = 15.29, and N = 530, Mage = 31.75), we applied an extension procedure for confirmatory factor analysis that enables a simultaneous investigation of the relationships on all levels. The perseverance facet of grit was tightly aligned to the common factors (95\% shared variance) and was strongly related to the industriousness factor. Consistency shared less variance with the common factors of conscientiousness (53\%), but it was additionally correlated with the self-discipline facet. The results for the global grit scale were most similar to the results for perseverance. Grit appears to be a construct that combines the superordinate and industrious aspects of conscientiousness and shares the unique aspect of the self-discipline facet; this suggests that grit and its facets can be fully integrated into the hierarchical structure of conscientiousness.},

In the work reported here, we showed that this is not the whole story: Three-year-old children are promiscuous normativists. In other words, they spontaneously inferred the presence of social norms even when an adult had done nothing to indicate such a norm in either language or behavior. And children of this age even went so far as to enforce these self-inferred norms when third parties ``broke'' them. These results suggest that children do not just passively acquire social norms from adult behavior and instruction; rather, they have a natural and proactive tendency to go from ``is'' to ``ought.'' That is, children go from observed actions to prescribed actions and do not perceive them simply as guidelines for their own behavior but rather as objective normative rules applying to everyone equally.},

Specifically, decision-difficulty is expressed as proximity, for instance when people say that a decision was ``too close to call''. Although these expressions are metaphorical, we argue, in line with research on conceptual metaphor theory, that they reflect how people think about difficult decisions. Thus, here we examine whether close spatial distance can actually make decision-making harder. In six experiments (total N~=~672), participants chose between two choice options presented either close together or far apart. As predicted, close (rather than far) choice options led to more difficulty, both in self-report (Experiment 1A\textendash 1C) and behavioral measures (decision-time, Experiment 2 and 3). Identifying a boundary condition, we show that close choice options lead to more difficulty only for within-category choices (Experiment 3). The too-close-to-call effect is theoretically and methodologically relevant for a broad array of research where choice options are visually presented, ranging from social cognition, judgment and decision-making to more applied settings in consumer psychology and marketing.},

As a result, only weakly, but not strongly, identified students should feel (externally) pressured by and respond to excellence norms with negative affect.

  abstract = {Abstract The initial step in the amyloidogenic cascade of amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing is catalyzed by beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme (BACE), and this protease has increased activities in affected areas of Alzheimer's disease brains. We hypothesized that altered APP processing, because of augmented BACE activity, would affect the actions of direct and indirect BACE inhibitors. We therefore compared post-mitotic human neurons (LUHMES) with their BACE-overexpressing counterparts (BLUHMES). Although ?-cleavage of APP was strongly increased in BLUHMES, they produced less full-length and truncated amyloid beta (A?) than LUHMES. Moreover, low concentrations of BACE inhibitors decreased cellular BACE activity as expected, but increased A?1-40 levels. Several other approaches to modulate BACE activity led to a similar, apparently paradoxical, behavior. For instance, reduction in intracellular acidification by bepridil increased A? production in parallel with decreased BACE activity. In contrast to BLUHMES, the respective control cells (LUHMES or BLUHMES with catalytically inactive BACE) showed conventional pharmacological responses. Other non-canonical neurochemical responses (so-called ?rebound effects?) are well-documented for the A? pathway, especially for ?-secretase: a partial block of its activity leads to an increased A? secretion by some cell types. We therefore compared LUHMES and BLUHMES regarding rebound effects of ?-secretase inhibitors and found an A? rise in LUHMES but not in BLUHMES. Thus, different cellular factors are responsible for the ?-secretase- versus BACE-related A? rebound. We conclude that increased BACE activity, possibly accompanied by an altered cellular localization pattern, can dramatically influence A? generation in human neurons and affect pharmacological responses to secretase inhibitors.

Typically, these hypotheses have been investigated by using difference scores or other profile similarity indices as predictors of the outcome variables. These approaches, however, have been vigorously criticized for their conceptual and statistical shortcomings. Here, we introduce a statistical method that is based on polynomial regression and addresses most of these shortcomings: dyadic response surface analysis. This model is tailored for similarity effect hypotheses and fully accounts for the dyadic nature of relationship data. Furthermore, we provide a tutorial with an illustrative example and reproducible R and Mplus scripts that should assist substantive researchers in precisely formulating, testing, and interpreting their dyadic similarity effect hypotheses. ? 2018 European Association of Personality Psychology},

  abstract = {Research into the effects of climate on political and economic outcomes assumes that short-term variation in weather is exogenous to the phenomena being studied. However, weather data are derived from stations operated by national governments, whose political capacity and stability affect the quality and continuity of coverage. We show that civil conflict risk in sub-Saharan Africa is negatively correlated with the number and density of weather stations contributing to a country's temperature record. This effect is both cross-sectional\textemdash countries with higher average conflict risk tend to have poorer coverage\textemdash and cross-temporal\textemdash civil conflict leads to loss of weather stations. Poor coverage induces a small downward bias in one widely used temperature data set, due to its interpolation method, and increases measurement error, potentially attenuating estimates of the temperature\textendash conflict relationship. Combining multiple observational data sets to reduce measurement error almost doubles the estimated effect of temperature anomalies on civil conflict risk.},

Our results show that children explore more eagerly than adults but obtain lower rewards. We built a predictive model of search to disentangle the unique contributions of the three hypotheses of developmental differences and found robust and recoverable parameter estimates indicating that children generalize less and rely on directed exploration more than adults.

As a consequence, people overestimate the extent to which recipients of their self-promotion will feel proud of and happy for them, and underestimate the extent to which recipients will feel annoyed (Experiments 1 and 2). Because people tend to promote themselves excessively when trying to make a favorable impression on others, such efforts often backfire, causing targets of self-promotion to view self-promoters as less likeable and as braggarts (Experiment 3).},

We evaluated the judgments of 450 participants who completed an AGL task. For each trial, participants decided whether a stimulus conformed to a given set of rules and rated their confidence in that judgment. We identified participants who performed at chance on the discrimination task, utilizing a subset of their responses, and then assessed the accuracy and the confidence-accuracy relationship of their remaining responses. Analyses revealed above-chance metacognition among participants who did not exhibit decision accuracy. This important new phenomenon, which we term blind insight, poses critical challenges to prevailing models of metacognition grounded in signal detection theory.},

We hypothesized that representing the associations using personality questionnaire items (as markers for personality nuances) could increase prediction strength. Using the National Child Development Study (N = 8719), we predicted 40 diverse outcomes from both the Big Five domains and their 50 items. Models were trained (using penalized regression) and applied for prediction in independent sample partitions (with 100 permutations). Item models tended to out-predict Big Five models (explaining on average 30\% more variance), regardless of outcomes' independently rated breadth versus behavioural specificity. Moreover, the predictive power of Big Five domains per se was at least partly inflated by the unique variance of their constituent items, especially for generally more predictable outcomes. Removing the Big Five variance from items marginally reduced their predictive power. These findings are consistent with the possibility that the associations of personality with outcomes often pertain to (potentially large numbers of) specific behavioural, cognitive, affective, and motivational characteristics represented by single questionnaire items rather than to the broader (underlying) traits that these items are ostensibly indicators of.

  abstract = {Self-consciousness consists of several dissociable experiences, including the sense of ownership of one's body and the sense of agency over one's action consequences. The relationship between body-ownership and the sense of agency has been described by different neurocognitive models, each providing specific neurofunctional predictions. According to an ``additive'' model, the sense of agency entails body-ownership, while an alternative ``independence'' hypothesis suggests that they represent two qualitatively different processes, underpinned by distinct brain systems. We propose a third ``interactive'' model, arguing the interdependence between body-ownership and the sense of agency: these constructs might represent different experiences with specific and exclusive brain correlates, but they also could partly overlap at the neurofunctional level. Here we test these three neurocognitive models by reviewing the available neurofunctional literature of body-ownership and the sense of agency, with a quantitative meta-analytical approach that allowed us to compare their neural correlates statistically. We identified (i) a body-ownership-specific network including the left inferior parietal lobule and the left extra-striate body area, (ii) a sense-of-agency-specific network including the left SMA, the left posterior insula, the right postcentral gyrus, and the right superior temporal lobe and (iii) a shared network in the left middle insula. These results provide support for the interactive neurocognitive model of body-ownership and the sense of agency. Body-ownership involves a sensory network in which multisensory inputs are integrated to be self-attributed. On the other hand, the sense of agency is specifically associated with premotor and sensory-motor areas, typically involved in generating motor predictions and in action monitoring. Finally, body-ownership and the sense of agency interact at the level of the left middle insula, a high-level multisensory hub engaged in body and action awareness in general.},

Critically, however, in most investigations on the topic, researchers have not separately assessed each type of mind wandering; instead, they have measured mind wandering as a unitary construct, thereby conflating intentional and unintentional types. We report the first compelling evidence that an experimental manipulation can have qualitatively different effects on intentional and unintentional types of mind wandering. This result provides clear evidence that researchers interested in understanding mind wandering need to consider the distinction between unintentional and intentional occurrences of this phenomenon.},

Natural variance in the training schedule assigned participants to receive training before or after solving an unannounced business case modeled on the decision to launch the Space Shuttle Challenger. We used case solutions to surreptitiously measure participants' susceptibility to confirmation bias. Trained participants were 29\% less likely to choose the inferior hypothesis-confirming solution than untrained participants. Analysis of case write-ups suggests that a reduction in confirmatory hypothesis testing accounts for their improved decision making in the case.

We briefly review the various terms and uses of ILMs in various fields of psychology and present five main strategies that can help researchers infer causality in ILM studies. We discuss the use of temporal precedence to establish causality, through both lagged analyses and natural experiments; the use of external measures and peer reports to go beyond self-report data; delving deeper into repeated measures to derive new indices; the use of contextual factors occurring during the measurement period; and combining experimental methods and ILMs. These strategies are illustrated by examples from existing research and by new empirical findings from two dyadic daily diary studies (N = 80 and N = 108 couples) and an experience sampling method study of personality states (N = 52). We conclude by offering a short checklist for designing ILM studies with causality in mind and look at the applicability of these strategies in the intersection of personality psychology and other psychological research domains.

Study 2 found that this pattern of effects extended to the willingness to engage in collective action on behalf of undocumented immigrants. Study 2 also examined the role of emotions (anger and fear) in mediating the relationship between the conflation of Latinxs with undocumented immigrants and collective action intentions. Together, the findings shed light on how current immigration policies affect relations among key subgroups within the Latinx community and the conditions under which Latinx-Americans will mobilize on behalf of undocumented immigrants.},

One soldier fatality implies a 0.13 percentage point reduction in the local health budget share (2008\textendash 12). Health budget cuts due to a single soldier fatality result in 76 predicted additional infant deaths 2 years later. We show that the effect on health budgeting operates through decreases in women's use of health facilities and postnatal services.

In this article, we show that when scarcity does influence cognition, it renders people less susceptible to classic context effects. Under conditions of scarcity, people focus on pressing needs and recognize the trade-offs that must be made against those needs. Those trade-offs frame perception more consistently than irrelevant contextual cues, which exert less influence. The results suggest that scarcity can align certain behaviors more closely with traditional economic predictions.},

This argument makes two key predictions, which we investigated in eight studies using workplace scenarios. First, we predicted and found that, when the decision was public, allocators were reluctant to give a bonus to a deserving employee when that employee was a friend rather than a non-friend. In private, however, participants were willing to give the bonus to the deserving person whether she was a friend or a non-friend, suggesting that their public behavior was aimed at avoiding the appearance of bias. Second, we predicted and found that allocators' reluctance to give a bonus to a deserving friend is mediated by their beliefs that others would find this behavior to be unfair. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of this bias resulting from a desire to avoid appearing partial.},

In three studies (N = 501), 7- to 8-year-olds were more likely than 4- to 6-year-olds to create inequity that disadvantaged themselves\textemdash a fair type of inequity. In findings consistent with our theory, 7- to 8-year-olds were not more likely than 4- to 6-year-olds to endorse advantageous inequity (Study 1) or inequity created by third parties (Studies 2 and 3)\textemdash unfair types of inequity. We discuss how these results expand on recent accounts of children's developing concerns with generosity and partiality.},

  abstract = {People quickly infer trustworthiness from faces and use it to guide judgments and behaviors. Past research has suggested that face information is too powerful to be overridden by behavioral evidence, especially implicitly, suggesting that untrustworthiness in faces might be an insurmountable influence in impressions of others. In 5 studies, however, we found that implicit impressions of untrustworthy faces can be effectively updated by learning new, counterattitudinal behavioral information under certain conditions. We showed that face-based implicit impressions were rapidly updated regardless of the degree of untrustworthiness in the face (Study 1), but only when new, propositional information was extreme and diagnostic (Study 2). Successful updating of untrustworthy faces occurred even under low cognitive capacity (Studies 3A and 3B), suggesting efficient processing of inconsistent information. In addition, expanding the conditions under which updating can emerge, we also found that face-based implicit impressions of trustworthiness can be updated using valenced information (positive, negative) rather than just trustworthy-specific counterevidence (Study 4). We discuss the implications of these findings for whether facial cues of untrustworthiness are surmountable in person perception, how people learn about the trustworthiness of others, and the updating of implicit impressions more generally.},

The aurora kinases A (AURKA), B (AURKB), and C (AURKC) are potential therapeutic targets in proliferating cells. However, their role has not been clarified in microglia. The aim of this study was to examine the regulation of aurora kinases and their roles and druggability in spinal microgliosis and neuropathic pain. Sprague\textendash Dawley rats received chronic constriction injury (CCI). Gene expression of aurora kinases A-C was evaluated by quantitative RT-PCR and western blot, respectively, in spinal cords at 1, 3, 7, and 14 days after CCI. AURKB gene and protein expression was up-regulated concomitantly with the development of spinal microgliosis and neuropathic pain. Using lentiviral over-expression and adeno-associated viral knockdown approaches, the function of AURKB was further investigated by western blot, immunohistochemistry, RNA sequencing, and pain behavior tests. We found that AURKB over-expression in naive rats caused spinal microgliosis and pain hypersensitivity, whereas AURKB knockdown reduced microgliosis and alleviated CCI-induced neuropathic pain. Accordingly, RNA sequencing data revealed down-regulation of genes critically involved in signaling pathways associated with spinal microgliosis and neuropathic pain after AURKB knockdown in CCI rats. To examine its therapeutic potential for treatment of neuropathic pain, animals were treated intrathecally with the pharmacological AURKB inhibitor AZD1152-HQPA resulting in the alleviation of CCI-induced pain. Taken together, our findings indicated that AURKB plays a critical role in spinal microgliosis and neuropathic pain. Targeting AURKB may be an efficient method for treatment of neuropathic pain subsequent to peripheral nerve injury.},

We distinguished between people (N = 11,390) who (1) own a gun for protection, (2) own a gun exclusively for reasons other than protection (e.g., collecting, sports), and (3) do not own a gun. Protection owners felt less safe on campus and supported allowing guns on campus. They also reported that they and others would feel safer and that gun violence would decrease if they carried a gun on campus. Non-owners and non-protection owners felt the reverse.

Adolescents underwent fMRI while viewing photos ostensibly submitted to Instagram. They were more likely to like photos depicted with many likes than photos with few likes; this finding showed the influence of virtual peer endorsement and held for both neutral photos and photos of risky behaviors (e.g., drinking, smoking). Viewing photos with many (compared with few) likes was associated with greater activity in neural regions implicated in reward processing, social cognition, imitation, and attention. Furthermore, when adolescents viewed risky photos (as opposed to neutral photos), activation in the cognitive-control network decreased. These findings highlight possible mechanisms underlying peer influence during adolescence.},

  abstract = {Abstract Previous studies in our laboratory have shown that nicotine exposure decreases glucose transport across the blood?brain barrier in ischemia-reperfusion conditions. We hypothesize that nicotine can also dysregulate brain parenchymal glucose utilization by altering glucose transporters with effects on sensitivity to ischemic stroke. In this study, we investigated the effects of nicotine exposure on neuronal glucose utilization using an in~vitro ischemic stroke model. We also tested the effects of e-Cig vaping on ischemic brain glucose utilization using an acute brain slice technique. Primary cortical neurons and brain slices were subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation followed by reoxygenation to mimic ischemia-reperfusion injury. We estimated brain cell glucose utilization by measuring the uptake of [3H] deoxy-d-glucose. Immunofluorescence and western blotting were done to characterize glucose transporters (GLUTs) and {$\alpha$}7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) expression. Furthermore, we used a glycolytic stress test to measure the effects of nicotine exposure on neuronal glucose metabolism. We observed that short- and long-term nicotine/cotinine exposure significantly decreased neuronal glucose utilization in ischemic conditions and the non-specific nAChR antagonist, mecamylamine reversed this effect. Nicotine/cotinine exposure also decreased neuronal GLUT1 and up-regulated {$\alpha$}7 nAChR expression and decreased glycolysis. Exposure of mice to e-Cig vapor for 7~days likewise decreases brain glucose uptake under normoxic and ischemic conditions along with down-regulation of GLUT1 and GLUT3 expressions. These data support, from a cerebrovascular perspective, that nicotine and/or e-Cig vaping induce a state of glucose deprivation at the neurovascular unit which could lead to enhanced ischemic brain injury and/or stroke risk.

  abstract = {Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is a chronic disease, characterized by severe and refractory seizures, triggered in the hippocampus and/or amygdala, disrupting the blood\textendash brain barrier. This disruption can sustain, or aggravate, the epileptic condition. The aim of this study was to evaluate the activation of the kallikrein-kinin system in patients with TLE, as it relates to the maintenance of blood\textendash brain barrier. Human hippocampal sclerotic tissues removed after surgery for seizure control, plasma, and serum were used in the following assays: immunostaining for white blood cells in the TLE hippocampus, C-reactive protein in serum, quantification of plasma kallikrein (PKal) and cathepsin B (CatB) activity in serum and plasma, quantification of C1-inhibitor, analysis of high-molecular-weight kininogen (H-kininogen) fragments, and activation of plasma prekallikrein for comparison with healthy controls. Infiltration of white blood cells in the sclerotic hippocampus and a significant increase in the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio in the blood of TLE patients were observed. High levels of C-reactive protein (TLE = 1.4 {$\pm$} 0.3 \textmu g/mL), PKal (TLE = 5.4 {$\pm$} 0.4 U/mL), and CatB (TLE = 4.9 {$\pm$} 0.4 U/mL) were also evident in the serum of TLE patients comparing to controls. A strong linear correlation was observed between active CatB and PKal in the serum of TLE patients (r = 0.88). High levels of cleaved H-kininogen and free PKal, and low levels of C1-inhibitor (TLE = 188 {$\pm$} 12 \textmu g/mL) were observed in the serum of TLE patients. Our data demonstrated that the plasma kallikrein-kinin system is activated in patients with TLE.

As found in prior research, we observed that while people make decisions, their preferences for the attributes in question shift to support the emerging choice, thus enabling confident decisions. The novelty of the studies reported here is that participants repeated the same task 6 to 8 weeks later. We found that between tasks, preferences returned to near their original levels, only to shift again to support the second choice, regardless of which choice participants made. Similar patterns were observed in a free-choice task (Study 1) and when the favorableness of options was manipulated (Study 2). It follows that preferences behave in an elastic manner: In the absence of situational pressures, they rest at baseline levels, but during the process of reaching a decision, they morph to support the chosen options. This elasticity appears to facilitate confident decision making in the face of decisional conflict.},

We tested here whether acute stress may modulate the balance of cue-dependent and contextual fear learning. Participants (N = 72) underwent a stress or control manipulation 30 min before they completed a fear-learning task in a virtual environment that allowed both cued and contextual fear learning. Results showed equally strong cue- and context-dependent fear conditioning in the control group. Stress, however, abolished contextual fear learning, which was directly correlated with the activity of the stress hormone cortisol, and made cue-dependent fear more resistant to extinction. These results are the first to show that stress favors cue-dependent over contextual fear learning.},

Current approaches provide an incomplete account of statehouse democracy because they fail to compare preferences and policies on meaningful scales. Here, we overcome this problem by generating estimates of Americans' preferences on the minimum wage and compare them to observed policies both within and across states. Because we measure both preferences and policies on the same scale (U.S. dollars), we can quantify both the association of policy outcomes with preferences across states (responsiveness) and their deviation within states (bias). We demonstrate that while minimum wages respond to corresponding preferences across states, policy outcomes are more conservative than preferences in each state, with the average policy bias amounting to about two dollars. We also show that policy bias is substantially smaller in states with access to direct democratic institutions.},

It combines effect-size estimation with hypothesis testing, assessing the extent to which the replication results are consistent with an effect size big enough to have been detectable in the original study. The approach is demonstrated by examining replications of three well-known findings. Its benefits include the following: (a) differentiating ``unsuccessful'' replication attempts (i.e., studies yielding p {$>$} .05) that are too noisy from those that actively indicate the effect is undetectably different from zero, (b) ``protecting'' true findings from underpowered replications, and (c) arriving at intuitively compelling inferences in general and for the revisited replications in particular.},

  abstract = {Many psychological theories predict U-shaped relationships: The effect of x is positive for low values of x, but negative for high values, or vice versa. Despite implying merely a change of sign, hypotheses about U-shaped functions are tested almost exclusively via quadratic regressions, an approach that imposes an arbitrary functional-form assumption that in some scenarios can lead to a 100\% rate of false positives (e.g., the incorrect conclusion that y = log(x) is U shaped). Estimating two regression lines, one for low and one for high values of x, allows testing for a sign change without a functional-form assumption. I introduce the Robin Hood algorithm as a way to set the break point between the lines. This algorithm delivers higher power to detect U shapes than all the other break-point-setting alternatives I compared with it. The article includes simulations demonstrating the performance of the two-lines test and reanalyses of published results using this test. An app for running the two-lines test is available at http://webstimate.org/twolines.},

However, little research in moral psychology investigates how relational factors impact moral judgment, and a theoretically grounded approach to such investigations is lacking. We used Relational Models Theory and Moral Foundations Theory to explore how varying actor-victim relationships impacts judgment of different types of moral violations. Across three studies, using a diverse range of moral violations and varying the experimental design, relational context substantially influenced third-party judgment of moral violations, and typically independent of several factors strongly associated with moral judgment. Results lend novel but mixed support to Relationship Regulation Theory and provide some novel implications for Moral Foundations Theory. These studies highlight the importance of relational factors in moral psychology and provide guidelines for exploring how relational factors might shape moral judgment.},

The theory suggests that parties will pivot toward programmatic vote-seeking strategies and away from clientelistic tactics, such as vote buying, where voting is compulsory. I test my expectations in three separate studies, using several data sources and empirical approaches. In Study 1, cross-national analyses show that parties behave more programmatically under compulsory voting and that vote buying is less common where voting is mandatory. In Study 2, synthetic control and difference-in-differences analyses show that a switch to compulsory voting in Thailand produced an increase in programmatic vote seeking. In Study 3, a list experiment conducted in tandem with a natural experiment shows that compulsory voting leads parties to rely less on vote-buying tactics in Argentina. I conclude by discussing the implications of these findings, which together are broadly supportive of my theoretical expectations.},

The current work investigates this trade-off by comparing speaker variability effects on L2 vocabulary learning in different age groups. Existing literature suggests that speaker variability benefits L2 vocabulary learning in adults, but this may not be the case for younger learners. In this study native English-speaking adults, 7- to 8-year-olds, and 10- to 11-year-olds learned six novel Lithuanian words from a single speaker, and six from eight speakers. In line with previous research, adults showed better production of the multispeaker items at test. No such benefit was found for either group of children, either in production or comprehension. Children also had greater difficulties in processing multiple-speaker cues during training. We conclude that age-related capacity limitations may constrain the ability to utilize speaker variability when learning words in a new language.},

  abstract = {P2X receptors (P2XRs) are ATP-gated cationic channels that are allosterically modulated by numerous compounds, including steroids and neurosteroids. These compounds may both inhibit and potentiate the activity of P2XRs, but sex steroids such as 17{$\beta$}-estradiol or progesterone are reported to be inactive. Here, we tested a hypothesis that testosterone, another sex hormone, modulates activity of P2XRs. We examined actions of native testosterone and a series of testosterone derivatives on the gating of recombinant P2X2R, P2X4R and P2X7R and native channels expressed in pituitary cells and hypothalamic neurons. The 17{$\beta$}-ester derivatives of testosterone rapidly and positively modulate the 1 \textmu M ATP-evoked currents in P2X2R- and P2X4R-expressing cells, but not agonist-evoked currents in P2X7R-expressing cells. In general, most of the tested testosterone derivatives are more potent modulators than endogenous testosterone. The comparison of chemical structures and whole-cell recordings revealed that their interactions with P2XRs depend on the lipophilicity and length of the alkyl chain at position C-17. Pre-treatment with testosterone butyrate or valerate increases the sensitivity of P2X2R and P2X4R to ATP by several fold, reduces the rate of P2X4R desensitization, accelerates resensitization, and enhances ethidium uptake by P2X4R. Native channels are also potentiated by testosterone derivatives, while endogenously expressed GABA receptors type A are inhibited. The effect of ivermectin, a P2X4R-specific allosteric modulator, on deactivation is antagonized by testosterone derivatives in a concentration-dependent manner. Together, our results provide evidence for potentiation of particular subtypes of P2XRs by testosterone derivatives and suggest a potential role of ivermectin binding site for steroid-induced modulation.

  abstract = {Planning is a future-directed thought process that is highly beneficial, but it requires mental effort. Informed by the strength model of self-regulation, four studies (N = 546) tested the hypothesis that willingness to plan is linked to good self-control. A correlational study (N = 201) found that people high in trait self-control had done more planning than other people and also intended to make more plans during the upcoming week. A laboratory experiment (N = 105) induced a state of ego depletion (i.e., impaired self-control) by having some participants continuously break pre-established motoric habits, and afterward these participants were less willing to make plans for the next four weeks than control participants. A field experiment (N = 112) used a naturally occurring induction of decision fatigue (IKEA shopping) and again found that ego depletion reduced planning. Specifically, fatigued shoppers exiting the store expressed more reluctance to make long-term plans than shoppers who were just arriving at the store. A final laboratory experiment (N = 128) found that ego-depleted participants were only half as likely to choose a planning task as control participants, and identified effort avoidance as a mediator mechanism. Crucially, the three experimental manipulations were longer and stronger than the 5-min depletion tasks often used in previous research (24 min; 2 h; 30 min), and manipulation checks confirmed severe and significant ego depletion. Depletion had no effects on aspirational goals or the desire to relax. We conclude that wants and desires come easily, while planning requires mental work akin to self-control. Theoretical and methodological implications are discussed.},

Using this novel paradigm to capture 900 observations of targets' behavior (as trustworthy or untrustworthy), we found that face-based judgments predicted trustworthiness. We also found that this effect was mediated by targets' expectations of how other people would perceive them and by their intentions to act in accordance with those expectations. These results are consistent with an internalized-impressions account: Targets internalize other people's appearance-based expectations and act in accordance with them, which leads facial-appearance-based judgments to be accurate.},

The preparatory steps necessary to organize, curate, image, and structure the meteorological information, prior to transcribing the historical data, are outlined here in an integrated methodology. The initial organization, the development of an image file nomenclature to link the rescued data to the original source, and the description of a metadata schema to optimize the transcription application are all vital to the process of ensuring traceability and transparency in the data rescue process. Taken together, these steps describe best practices guidelines for similar projects.

Herein we describe the procedures for acquiring ship and instrumental metadata and the one-minute interval observations from 44 research vessels that have contributed to the SAMOS initiative from 2005 to 2017. The overall data processing workflow and quality control procedures are documented along with data file formats and version control procedures. The SAMOS data are disseminated to the user community via web, FTP, and Thematic Real-time Environmental Distributed Data Services from both the Marine Data Center at the Florida State University and the National Centers for Environmental Information, which serves as the long-term archive for the SAMOS initiative. They have been used to address topics ranging from air-sea interaction studies, the calibration, evaluation, and development of satellite observational products, the evaluation of numerical atmospheric and ocean models, and the development of new tools and techniques for geospatial data analysis in the informatics community. Maps provide users the geospatial coverage within the SAMOS dataset, with a focus on the Essential Climate/Ocean Variables, and recommendations are made regarding which versions of the dataset should be accessed by different user communities.

Prior studies have focused mainly on typicality's influence on attractiveness, although recent studies have cast doubt on its importance for attractiveness judgments. Here, we argue that face typicality is an important factor for social perception because it affects trustworthiness judgments, which approximate the basic evaluation of faces. This effect has been overlooked because trustworthiness and attractiveness judgments have a high level of shared variance for most face samples. We show that for a continuum of faces that vary on a typicality-attractiveness dimension, trustworthiness judgments peak around the typical face. In contrast, perceived attractiveness increases monotonically past the typical face, as faces become more like the most attractive face. These findings suggest that face typicality is an important determinant of face evaluation.},

Matching our intervention's pharmacological specificity with a quantitative model delineating decision-making components allowed us to identify the causal relationships between arousal and decision making that do and do not exist. Propranolol selectively reduced loss aversion in a baseline- and dose-dependent manner (i.e., as a function of initial loss aversion and body mass index), and did not affect risk attitudes or choice consistency. These findings provide evidence for a specific, modulatory, and causal relationship between precise components of emotion and risky decision making.},

Oddly, however, income inequality is often found to affect vulnerable low-income and advantaged high-income groups equally. We argue that economic vulnerability is better captured by a financial-scarcity measure and hypothesize that income inequality primarily impairs the psychological health of people facing scarcity. First, repeated cross-sectional international data (from the World Values Survey: 146,034 participants; 105 country waves) revealed that the within-country effect of national income inequality on feelings of unhappiness was limited to individuals facing scarcity ({$\approx$}25\% of the World Values Survey population). Second, longitudinal national data (Swiss Household Panel: 14,790 participants; 15,595 municipality years) revealed that the within-life-course effect of local income inequality on psychological health problems was also limited to these individuals ({$<$} 10\% of the Swiss population). Income inequality by itself may not be a problem for psychological health but, rather, may be a catalyst for the consequences of financial scarcity.},

A network model of psychopathology assumes that observable features of disorders directly interact, and network analytic methods quantify how central each feature is. We conducted a network analysis of core deficits of BPD features using a large (N = 4,386) sample of participants with a range of BPD features. The most central features of participants in the High BPD group were loneliness, recklessness/impulsivity, and intense moods, supporting models of emotion dysregulation and interpersonal problems. The networks of BPD features did not differ between men and women. We provide directions for future research to enhance our understanding of how networks of BPD features change over time.},

This is especially challenging for executives conducting covert activities, as infractions are unobservable and institutional reforms often require the executive's consent. We develop a model based in the auditing literature to investigate when executives agree to reforms that credibly constrain their behaviors. If the revelation cost falls in a high range, the risk of whistleblowing convinces executives to restrain themselves. Executives cannot credibly commit to this when the costs are low, resulting in inefficient investigations from watchdog groups that tax executive resources. We show that executives are sometimes better off in the first case than the second, which results in executives endogenously reforming institutions to achieve this outcome. We illustrate the mechanism with a case study of Gerald Ford's executive reforms to the intelligence community in the 1970s.},

We theorized that, when others change, it can lead observers to infer that whatever factors had loomed large as barriers to change do not, in fact, prevent change. If so, dynamic norms may alter diverse salient mechanisms of personal change, and encourage behavior change in diverse contexts. Investigating four domains\textemdash smokers' intention to quit, dietary choice, sleep-related behavior, and men's identification as feminist\textemdash Experiments 1\textendash 4 found that dynamic norms affected three well-established mechanisms of personal behavior change across contexts: the belief that personal change is possible (increased self-efficacy), the belief that change is important to others (injunctive norms), and the belief that change is compatible with one's social identity. In each case, change in the psychological process also statistically mediated change in personal interest and intentions to change. Experiment 5 tested our hypothesis that psychological barriers that loom large would be remedied most. Manipulating the salience of all three barriers within a single context, we found that dynamic norms had a larger impact on salient than less salient barriers. The results suggest that dynamic norms can help resolve diverse psychological barriers to encourage personal change, especially salient barriers. They may thus be a particularly robust source of social influence across contexts.},

  abstract = {When people are choosing among different options, context seems to play a vital role. For instance, adding a third option can increase the probability of choosing a similar dominating option. This attraction effect is one of the most widely studied phenomena in decision-making research. Its prevalence, however, has been challenged recently by the tainting hypothesis, according to which the inferior option contaminates the attribute space in which it is located, leading to a repulsion effect. In an attempt to test the tainting hypothesis and explore the conditions under which dominated options make dominating options look bad, we conducted four preregistered perceptual decision-making studies with a total of 301 participants. We identified two factors influencing individuals' behavior: stimulus display and stimulus design. Our results contribute to a growing body of literature showing how presentation format influences behavior in preferential and perceptual decision-making tasks.},

  abstract = {Abstract Improper protein folding and trafficking are common pathological events in neurodegenerative diseases that result in the toxic accumulation of misfolded proteins within the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). While low-level stimulation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) is protective, sustained UPR activation resulting from prolonged ER stress can promote neurotoxicity. The cell-autonomous mechanisms of the UPR have been extensively characterized. However, the cell-extrinsic role of the UPR under physiological and pathological states in the CNS remains to be elucidated. To begin to address this, we evaluated if transferring conditioned media between ER-stressed astrocytes and neurons could modulate their functional characteristics. Our results indicate that ER-stressed astrocytes and neurons secrete a molecule(s) with lipid characteristics which regulates both inflammatory and ER stress responses in other astrocytes, neurons, and microglia in~vitro. Initial exposure to this stress factor(s) confers resistance against subsequent ER stress to neurons. However, persistent exposure to this unidentified mediator(s) suppresses the initial protective effect and becomes cytotoxic. Overall, these findings provide insight into the cell non-autonomous influence of ER stress on cells of the central nervous system.

Here, we tested the hypothesis that economic inequality is associated with a wish for a strong leader in a study involving 28 countries from five continents (Study 1, N = 6,112), a study involving an Australian community sample (Study 2, N = 515), and two experiments (Study 3a, N = 96; Study 3b, N = 296). We found correlational (Studies 1 and 2) and experimental (Studies 3a and 3b) evidence for our prediction that higher inequality enhances the wish for a strong leader. We also found that this relationship is mediated by perceptions of anomie, except in the case of objective inequality in Study 1. This suggests that societal inequality enhances the perception that society is breaking down (anomie) and that a strong leader is needed to restore order (even when that leader is willing to challenge democratic values).},

Attributions in both domains activated a common set of brain regions, and individual differences in the domain-specific recruitment of one of these regions\textemdash the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC)\textemdash correlated with attributional accuracy in each domain. Overall, however, the DMPFC showed greater activation for attributions about social than about nonsocial situations, and this selective response to the social domain was greatest in participants who reported the highest levels of social expertise.

Prior studies have suggested that exposure to sexist humor leads men who are high in hostile sexism to behave in a discriminatory manner toward women, and feel less ashamed for doing so (Ford, Boxer, Armstrong, \& Edel, 2008). It was therefore predicted that sexist and rape jokes would increase rape myth acceptance and sexist behavior. Participants were 96 undergraduates. In partial support of predictions, sexist jokes increased rape myth acceptance among high-hostile sexist men more than nonsexist jokes, F(1, 42) = 5.58, p = .02, {$\eta$}P2 = .12. Additionally, among participants high in hostile sexism, sexist jokes increased rape myth acceptance more in men than in women, F(1, 42) = 4.97, p = .03, {$\eta$}P2 = .11. However, there was no evidence to suggest that sexist jokes increased sexist behavior by making participants less likely to donate to a women's organization. The implications of these empirical findings and participants' qualitative responses to the topics of rape and sexism are discussed, and amendments to Ford and Ferguson's (2004) prejudiced norm theory are proposed.},

Importantly, although engaging in multiple tasks may diminish performance, we found that, holding the activity constant, the mere perception of multitasking in fact improves performance. Across 32 studies (30 of which had performance-based incentives) containing a total of 8,242 participants, we found that individuals who perceived an activity as multitasking were more engaged and consequently outperformed those who perceived that same activity as single tasking.},

In particular, this work focuses on the identification of stable associations between personality on the factor and facet level, fluid intelligence, demography and app usage in 16 distinct categories. A total of 137 subjects (87 women and 50 men), with an average age of 24 (SD~=~4.72), participated in a 90?min psychometric lab session as well as in a subsequent 60?day data logging study in the field. Our data suggest that personality traits predict mobile application usage in several specific categories such as communication, photography, gaming, transportation and entertainment. Extraversion, conscientiousness and agreeableness are better predictors of mobile application usage than basic demographic variables in several distinct categories. Furthermore, predictive performance is slightly higher for single factor?in comparison with facet?level personality scores. Fluid intelligence and demographics additionally show stable associations with categorical app usage. In sum, this study demonstrates how individual differences can be effectively related to actual behaviour and how this can assist in understanding the behavioural underpinnings of personality.

I used data from over 5.5 million games of international tournament chess and found no evidence of a stereotype-threat effect. In fact, female players outperform expectations when playing men. Further analysis showed no influence of degree of challenge, player age, nor prevalence of female role models in national chess leagues on differences in performance when women play men versus when they play women. Though this analysis contradicts one specific mechanism of influence of gender stereotypes, the persistent differences between male and female players suggest that systematic factors do exist and remain to be uncovered.},

Our results show that differences in experiential processing, but not rational processing, moderated the effect of frame on choice. We suggest that future research should more closely examine the influence of experiential processing on making decisions, to gain a broader understanding of the conditions that contribute to the framing effect.},

This developmental difference also occurs for judgments of immoral actors: Three- to 5-year-olds again prefer the person who is not conflicted, whereas older children and adults judge that someone who struggles with the decision is morally superior.

These results were obtained using different indicators of health status, including both self-reported and interviewer-administered physical measures. Longitudinal mediation analyses showed perceived constraints to mediate the effect of poor health on cynicism. This effect remained robust even when adding an alternative mediator\textemdash depressive symptoms. Additional analyses showed that any particular health limitation was prospectively related to cynicism to the degree to which this limitation was associated with an increased sense of constraints in individuals' life. \textcopyright{} 2018 The Authors.

This effect was robust to controlling for couples' socioeconomic situation (e.g., household income), both partners' sociodemographic characteristics, and baseline health. Exploratory mediation analyses pointed toward partner and actor physical activity as sequential mediators.

  abstract = {A visual attention span (VAS) deficit has been widely reported in the Developmental Dyslexia (DD) literature, however, consensus regarding what underlies this problem and the nature of its relationship with reading ability remains elusive. Thirty-two children with DD (15 females) were compared with 23 age matched (12 females) and 17 reading matched controls (9 females) on the combined Theory of Visual Attention (CombiTVA) paradigm with traditional letter and novel symbol conditions. The DD group performed more slowly than the age matched controls in terms of processing speed, but similarly to reading matched controls. Moderation analyses revealed that the difference between the DD group and age matched controls was driven by children with equivalent, or relatively poorer, lexical compared with sublexical reading profiles. Results suggest that reduced processing speed indexes reading immaturity, particularly in DD individuals with relative lexical reading deficits, rather than being a unique contributor to reading dysfunction.},

  abstract = {Abstract Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are by-products of physiological mitochondrial metabolism that are involved in several cellular signaling pathways as well as tissue injury and pathophysiological processes, including brain ischemia/reperfusion injury. The mitochondrial respiratory chain is considered a major source of ROS; however, there is little agreement on how ROS release depends on oxygen concentration. The rate of H2O2 release by intact brain mitochondria was measured with an Amplex UltraRed assay using a high-resolution respirometer (Oroboros) equipped with a fluorescent optical module and a system of controlled gas flow for varying the oxygen concentration. Three types of substrates were used: malate and pyruvate, succinate and glutamate, succinate alone or glycerol 3-phosphate. For the first time we determined that, with any substrate used in the absence of inhibitors, H2O2 release by respiring brain mitochondria is linearly dependent on the oxygen concentration. We found that the highest rate of H2O2 release occurs in conditions of reverse electron transfer when mitochondria oxidize succinate or glycerol 3-phosphate. H2O2 production by complex III is significant only in the presence of antimycin A and, in this case, the oxygen dependence manifested mixed (linear and hyperbolic) kinetics. We also demonstrated that complex II in brain mitochondria could contribute to ROS generation even in the absence of its substrate succinate when the quinone pool is reduced by glycerol 3-phosphate. Our results underscore the critical importance of reverse electron transfer in the brain, where a significant amount of succinate can be accumulated during ischemia providing a backflow of electrons to complex I at the early stages of reperfusion. Our study also demonstrates that ROS generation in brain mitochondria is lower under hypoxic conditions than in normoxia.

Across four studies, we manipulated the gender and race composition of the persons depicted. The results suggest that five (plus or minus one) people constitutes the point at which a collection of persons is perceived less like separate individuals and more like a single, unified group.

Paradoxically, the sex differences in the magnitude of relative academic strengths and pursuit of STEM degrees rose with increases in national gender equality. The gap between boys' science achievement and girls' reading achievement relative to their mean academic performance was near universal. These sex differences in academic strengths and attitudes toward science correlated with the STEM graduation gap. A mediation analysis suggested that life-quality pressures in less gender-equal countries promote girls' and women's engagement with STEM subjects.},

Thirty-one patients with acute facial palsy and 30 healthy controls performed a well-established test battery with tasks both for mere face recognition (FACE) and for recognition of emotional facial expressions (EMO). Participants were tested at disease onset (t1) and about eight weeks thereafter (t2). Recognition accuracy did not differ between groups in FACE and EMO tasks at t1 and t2. By contrast, mean reaction time (RT) in the EMO task was significantly longer for patients than for controls at t1 (10.228~{$\pm~$}710~ms vs 7.386~{$\pm~$}283~ms; p~=~.001), whereas RT in the FACE task did not differ between groups. Parallel to clinical remission, patient's RTs in EMO tasks decreased but remained significantly prolonged at t2. Consistent with theories of embodied cognition, our findings show that facial palsy delays recognition of emotional facial expressions but not face recognition per se. Furthermore, normal accuracy of emotion recognition suggests efficient compensatory mechanisms that preserve this essential social function. We hypothesize that deficient sensorimotor embodiment may contribute to disturbances of non-verbal communication in patients with impaired facial motricity.},

Many studies have investigated the nomological network of multidimensional perfectionism by relating perfectionistic concerns and perfectionistic strivings to the Big Five personality traits. Results from these studies were largely inconsistent. In the present study, we meta-analytically integrated 672 effect sizes from 72 samples (N = 21 573) describing relations between multidimensional perfectionism and the Big Five personality traits. Perfectionistic concerns correlated positively with Neuroticism (r = 0.383) and negatively with Extraversion (r = -0.198), Agreeableness (r = -0.198), Conscientiousness (r = -0.111), and Openness (r = -0.087). Perfectionistic strivings correlated positively with Conscientiousness (r = 0.368), Openness (r = 0.121), Neuroticism (r = 0.090), and Extraversion (r = 0.067) and were unrelated to Agreeableness (r = 0.002). The measures of perfectionistic concerns and perfectionistic strivings moderated most of these relations. Meta-analytic structural equation modelling allowed controlling each perfectionism dimension for the respective other. This partialling increased all correlations with the exception of the previously positive correlation between perfectionistic strivings and Neuroticism, which ceased to be significant. The findings support the distinction between perfectionistic strivings and perfectionistic concerns and demonstrate how multidimensional perfectionism is situated in the context of broader personality traits. \textcopyright{} 2019 European Association of Personality Psychology},

As new legislators enter the assembly, the connections and knowledge of former members expire and lose value. Whereas increases in turnover or assembly size generate more former lawmakers who might lobby, such increases negatively affect former members' value as lobbyists. Interest groups accordingly hire fewer former legislators to lobby. Other factors, such as longer cooling-off periods or increased legislative staff resources, produce slight or no substantive effects on rates of revolving. Legislative characteristics mostly determine rates of revolving for former lawmakers.},

Structural equation models revealed that injury to the moral faculty plays the primary role in identity discontinuity. Other cognitive deficits, including amnesia, have no measurable impact on identity persistence. Accordingly, frontotemporal dementia has the greatest effect on perceived identity, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis has the least. We further demonstrated that perceived identity change fully mediates the impact of neurodegenerative disease on relationship deterioration between patient and caregiver. Our results mark a departure from theories that ground personal identity in memory, distinctiveness, dispositional emotion, or global mental function.},

Two groups were presented first with phrasal verbs and their meaning before they were prompted to retrieve the particles from memory. The difference between these 2 retrieval groups was that 1 group studied and then retrieved items 1 at a time, while the other group studied and retrieved them in sets. The 2 other groups received the exercises as trial-and-error events, where participants were prompted to guess the particles and were subsequently provided with the correct response. One group was given immediate feedback on each item, while the other group tackled sets of 14 items before receiving feedback. The effectiveness of these exercise implementations was compared through an immediate and a 1-week delayed posttest. The best test scores were obtained when the exercises had served the purpose of retrieval, although this advantage shrank in the delayed posttest (where scores were poor regardless of treatment condition). On average 70\% of the posttest errors produced by the learners who had tackled the exercises by trial-and-error were duplicates of incorrect responses they had supplied at the exercise stage, which indicates that corrective feedback was often ineffective.},

To overcome this problem, we developed and validated a unitary taxonomy of social power motives based on established delineations of social hierarchies: the dominance, prestige, and leadership account. While we could measure these motives both reliably and distinctively (study 1), we also showed they strongly related to a common power desire (study 2). Assessing their nomological networks (studies 3 and 4), we demonstrated distinct associations between the dominance motive (D: wanting to coerce others into adhering to one's will) and anger and verbal aggression; the prestige motive (P: wanting to obtain admiration and respect) and the fear of losing reputation and claiming to have higher moral concerns; the leadership motive (L: wanting to take responsibility in and for one's group) and emotional stability and helping behaviour. Furthermore, while D uniquely predicted agonistic/retaliatory behaviour in dictator games (study 5), L uniquely predicted the attainment of higher employment ranks in various professions (study 7). Finally, at least to some degree, P and L related positively, and D negatively to prosocial donating behaviour (study 6). This taxonomy represents a novel and powerful approach to predicting influential social behaviour. ? 2018 European Association of Personality Psychology},

However, the phase synchronization has been rarely considered in previous studies related to climate and biogeography due to a lack of a robust and quantitative approach. In this study, we proposed a synchronization index of temperature and precipitation (SI-TaP) and then investigated its global spatial distribution, interannual fluctuation, and long-term trend derived from a global 60-year dataset of meteorological forcings. Further investigation was conducted to understand the relationship between SI-TaP and the annually summed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), which could be a proxy of terrestrial vegetation productivity. Results show differences in both spatial patterns and temporal variations between SI-TaP and air temperature and precipitation, but SI-TaP may help to explain the distribution and productivity of terrestrial vegetation. About 60\% of regions where annually summed NDVI is greater than half of its maximum value overlap regions where SI-TaP is greater than half of its maximum value. By using SI-TaP to explain vegetation productivity along with temperature and precipitation, the maximum increase in the coefficient of determination is 0.66 across global lands. Results from this study suggest that the proposed SI-TaP index is helpful to better understand climate change and its relation to the biota.},

We examined this latter form of self-knowledge. Participants (248 people; 2,938 observations) wore the Electronically Activated Recorder (EAR), an unobtrusive audio recorder, and completed experience-sampling self-reports of their personality states four times each day for 1 week. We estimated state self-knowledge by comparing self-reported personality states with consensual observer ratings of personality states coded from the EAR files, which formed the criterion for what participants were ``actually'' like in the moment. People had self-insight into their momentary extraversion, conscientiousness, and likely neuroticism, suggesting that people can accurately detect fluctuations in some aspects of their personality. However, the evidence for self-insight was weaker for agreeableness. This apparent self-ignorance may be partly responsible for interpersonal problems and for blind spots in trait self-knowledge.},

  abstract = {Interleukin-33 (IL-33), a member of the IL1 family, has been found to be expressed in oligodendrocytes (OLGs) and released as an alarmin from injured OLGs to work on other glial cell-types in the central nervous system. However, its functional role in OLGs remains unclear. Herein, we present that IL-33 was mainly expressed in the nucleus of CC1+-oligodendrocytes (OLGs) in mouse and rat corpus callosum, as well as NG2+-oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs). The in vitro study indicated that the amount of IL-33 expressing in OPCs was higher when compared to that detected in OLGs. Results from the experiments using lentivirus-mediated shRNA delivery against IL-33 expression (IL33-KD) in OPCs showed that IL33-KD reduced the differentiation of OLGs into mature OLGs along with the down-regulation of OLG differentiation-related genes and mature OLG marker proteins, myelin basic protein (MBP) and proteolipid protein (PLP). Alternatively, we observed reduced differentiation of OLGs that were prepared from the brains of IL-33 gene knockout (IL33-KO) mice with anxiolytic-like behavior. Observations were correlated with the results showing lower levels of MBP and PLP in IL33-KO cultures than those detected in the control cultures prepared from wildtype (WT) mice. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) analysis revealed that the myelin structures in the corpus callosum of the IL33-KO mice were impaired compared to those observed in the WT mice. Overall, this study provides important evidence that declined expression of IL-33 in OPCs suppresses the maturation of OLGs. Moreover, gene deficiency of IL-33 can disrupt OLG maturation and interfere with myelin compaction. Cover Image for this issue: doi: 10.1111/jnc.14522},

This increased risk was not accounted for by common physical and psychological risk factors. The association between mortality and weight discrimination was generally stronger than that between mortality and other attributions for discrimination. In addition to its association with poor health outcomes, weight discrimination may shorten life expectancy.},

To address this question, we tested the association between personality profile normativeness (similarity between one's personality profile and the average profile\textemdash a proxy for the deviancy\textendash adjustment continuum) and creativity across four different samples (total N = 348 768). We used a wide range of creativity measures, including self-reported, informant-reported, behavioural, and occupational creativity, as well as several essential statistical controls (i.e., demographics, socio-economic background, intelligence, and life satisfaction). Furthermore, we employed both cross-sectional and longitudinal designs, including samples of college students and representative adult populations. We found that people who had more normative personality profiles were more creative. However, this association only held within modality (i.e. when both personality and creativity were either self-reported or informant-reported). We did not find robust associations between personality profile normativeness and laboratory-based behavioural measures of creativity, occupational creativity, or creative achievements. We discuss alternative explanations for the observed adjustment\textendash creativity link, specifically, implicit theories of creativity and person perception biases (halo effects). Notably, the findings did not support the idea that deviancy breeds creativity, suggesting that the famed `mad genius' hypothesis might not hold among the general population. \textcopyright{} 2019 European Association of Personality Psychology},

In recent years, it has become common to use intentional binding as an implicit measure of the sense of agency.

Here, we used a novel virtual-reality setup to demonstrate identical magnitude-binding effects in both the presence and complete absence of intentional action, when perceptual stimuli were matched for temporal and spatial information. Our results demonstrate that intentional-binding-like effects are most simply accounted for by multisensory causal binding without necessarily being related to intention or agency. Future studies that relate binding effects to agency must provide evidence for effects beyond that expected for multisensory causal binding by itself.},

Results showed that EI scores were correlated positively with metalinguistic knowledge, but they were not related to the SRT scores.

One hundred advanced L2 speakers of Japanese living in Japan were assessed using tests of automatized explicit knowledge and implicit knowledge, along with tests of phonological short?term memory and aptitude tests for explicit and implicit learning. Structural equation modeling demonstrated that aptitude for explicit learning significantly predicted acquisition of automatized explicit knowledge, and automatized explicit knowledge significantly predicted acquisition of implicit knowledge. The effects of implicit learning aptitude and phonological short?term memory on acquisition of automatized explicit knowledge and implicit knowledge were limited. These findings provide the first empirical evidence that automatized explicit knowledge, which develops through explicit learning mechanisms, may impact the acquisition of implicit knowledge.},

Protest attitude uniquely predicts both the political action tendencies of members of disadvantaged groups and willingness to engage in solidarity-based action on behalf of such groups. Furthermore, we find some evidence that protest attitude is able to account for the effects of mobilization messages over a political issue; these messages increase political action tendencies by making attitude towards protest more positive. The results indicate that overall attitude toward protest reflects a wide array of affective, cognitive, and behavioral factors associated with protest that more specific, established predictors of collective political action do not tap. As such, general protest attitude offers an important addition to extant models of collective political action and efforts to examine the psychological processes underpinning political cognition and action.},

In the context of ELF where English is used as a medium of communication among nonnative speakers as well as between native and nonnative speakers, researchers need to examine pragmatic competence based on how L2 learners can navigate communicative demands by using communication strategies skillfully while negotiating their identities. At the same time, it is tenable for teachers to move away from the sole dependence on idealized native-speaker models of appropriateness, politeness, and formality in their pedagogical practice and instead incorporate a nonessentialist viewpoint into formal instruction.

  abstract = {Many neurocognitive accounts of language processing presume that neural responses detected in grand mean analyses of cortical electrophysiological activity reflect the normative brain response in the population under investigation. However, emerging work now shows that individuals' brain responses can vary systematically in both the size and type of effect elicited. The present research therefore examined individual differences in neural activity elicited by grammatical agreement anomalies during language comprehension in a large cohort of highly literate, monolingual English speakers (N~=~114), a population generally assumed to be relatively homogenous in terms of linguistic knowledge and processing. Results showed systematic variability in event-related brain potentials (ERPs) elicited by subject-verb agreement anomalies, with brain responses varying on a continuum between N400 and P600 dominant responses. Similar variation was found both when agreement was realized via inflectional morphology or via lexical alternations. Individuals' brain response type correlated strongly across these two conditions. Similar variation was also found for ERPs elicited during rapid serial visual presentation and when self-paced ERPs were recorded. Multilevel latent variable regression showed that variation in brain response amplitude and type was not related to individual differences in language experience or verbal working memory capacity, despite high statistical power. These findings indicate that descriptions of processing dynamics predicated solely on grand mean analyses of central tendency can fail to provide an accurate, generalizable account of how processing unfolds in many or most individual members of the population studied. Furthermore, these findings show that systematic individual variation in engagement of neural system supporting grammatical processing is found even in language users at the highest end of the proficiency spectrum and in grammatically simple sentences. This study therefore has implications for studies of language processing in atypical populations.},

Capraro and Rand (Judgment and Decision Making, 13, 99\textendash 111, 2018) recently provided experimental evidence that prosociality in anonymous, one-shot interactions (such as Prisoner's Dilemma and Dictator Game experiments) is not driven by outcome-based social preferences \textendash{} as classically assumed \textendash{} but by a generalized morality preference for ``doing the right thing''. Here we argue that the key experiments reported in Capraro and Rand (2018) comprise prominent methodological confounds and open questions that bear on influential psychological theory. Specifically, their design confounds: (i) preferences for efficiency with self-interest; and (ii) preferences for action with preferences for morality. Furthermore, their design fails to dissociate the preference to do ``good'' from the preference to avoid doing ``bad''. We thus designed and conducted a preregistered, refined and extended test of the morality preference hypothesis (N = 801). Consistent with this hypothesis, our findings indicate that prosociality in the anonymous, one-shot Dictator Game is driven by preferences for doing the morally right thing. Inconsistent with influential psychological theory, however, our results suggest the preference to do ``good'' was as potent as the preference to avoid doing ``bad'' in this case.},

In the spatial condition, tasks were framed as measures of spatial ability on which males have an advantage. In the social condition, modified tasks contained human figures and were framed as measures of empathy on which females have an advantage. Results showed a sex difference in favor of males in the spatial condition but not the social condition. Experiments 2 and 3 indicated that both stereotype threat and including human figures contributed to these effects. Results suggest that females may underperform on spatial tests in part because of negative performance expectations and the character of the spatial tests rather than because of actual lack of abilities.},

In Study 1, participants spontaneously recalled autobiographical memories after being exposed to varying levels of threat. When the threat was identity-relevant, those who spontaneously recalled mastery autobiographical memories had higher collective self-esteem than those who did not. In Study 2, we instructed participants to recall either mastery autobiographical memories or routine memories. When the threat was identity-relevant, collective self-esteem was again higher for mastery recall compared to routine recall, moderated by national identification and self-esteem. We also found a general, self-affirmative effect of autobiographical memories, regardless of threat relevance or recall content.

  abstract = {The archaeology and history of the Republic of Azerbaijan is not widely known in
comparison with that of its neighbours. A recent summary of work in the Caucasus
(Smith and Rubinson 2003) contained no specific references to results from
Azerbaijan, although the studies were directly comparable and overlapped in period
and geography. The reasons for this are many, perhaps the most influential is the
presentation of material from Azerbaijan being confused with southern Azerbaijan in
Iran in the wider academic audience and the use of the Cyrillic alphabet for reports
written in the Azeri language over the past century.

The Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) and South Caucasus Pipelines (SCP) were constructed
through Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey during the period 2003-5. BTC was built first from the Caspian Coast to the Georgian border during 2003 and 2004, while the SCP pipeline was built from the Georgian border towards the Caspian and parallel to the BTC in 2005.  To investigate and mitigate the effects of this construction, a four year archaeological fieldwork programme (2001-2005) was carried out, followed by a further six-year post-excavation programme that ended in early 2011.

This article draws on this extensive archaeological project that combines both the broad corpus of material known in Azerbaijan and new techniques introduced in the Republic for the first time and used on a range of sites that are of both national and international significance.},

The Dual Hub account postulates that anterior temporal lobes (ATL) support taxonomic relationships based on shared physical features (mole \textendash{} cat), while temporoparietal regions, including posterior middle temporal gyrus (pMTG), support thematic associations (mole \textendash{} earth). Conversely, the Controlled Semantic Cognition account proposes that ATL supports both aspects of knowledge, while left pMTG contributes to controlled retrieval. This study used magnetoencephalography to test these contrasting predictions of functional dissociations within the temporal lobe. ATL and pMTG responded more strongly to taxonomic and thematic trials respectively, matched for behavioural performance, in line with predictions of the Dual Hub account. In addition, ATL showed a greater response to strong than weak thematic associations, while pMTG showed the opposite pattern, supporting a key prediction of the Controlled Semantic Cognition account. ATL showed a stronger response for word pairs that were more semantically coherent, either because they shared physical features (in taxonomic trials) or a strong thematic association. These effects largely coincided in time and frequency (although an early oscillatory response in ATL was specific to taxonomic trials). In contrast, pMTG showed non-overlapping effects of semantic control demands and thematic judgements: this site showed a larger oscillatory response to weak associations, when ongoing retrieval needed to be shaped to suit the task demands, and also a larger response to thematic judgements contrasted with taxonomic trials (which was reduced but not eliminated when the thematic trials were easier). Consequently, time-sensitive neuroimaging supports a complex pattern of functional dissociations within the left temporal lobe, which reflects both coherence versus control and distinctive oscillatory responses for taxonomic overlap (in ATL) and thematic relations (in pMTG).},

Meteorological information contained in these logbooks has been extracted to produce a historical climate dataset. We discuss various instructions recommended by the British Admiralty to observe and record weather conditions on-board whaling ships. Statistical tests were used to flag erroneous values and corrections were made using neighbouring values. Meteorological parameters such as air pressure, air and sea temperature and wind force on the Beaufort scale were standardized, converting imperial to metric units. The data were structured according to the internationally accepted International Maritime Meteorological Archive format, which includes the most commonly reported meteorological variables, including the time, location and ship-related meta-data. Hence, a readily accessible, error-corrected and standardized historical climate dataset of the Weddell Sea sector of the Southern Ocean is presented.

  abstract = {Introduction
Spatial remapping, the process of updating information across eye movements, is an important mechanism for trans-saccadic perception. The right posterior parietal cortex (PPC) is a region that has been associated most strongly with spatial remapping. The aim of the project was to investigate the effect of damage to the right PPC on direction specific trans-saccadic memory. We compared trans-saccadic memory performance for central items that had to be remembered while making a left- versus rightward eye movement, or for items that were remapped within the left versus right visual field.
Methods
We included 9 stroke patients with unilateral right PPC lesions and 31 healthy control subjects. Participants memorized the location of a briefly presented item, had to make one saccade (either towards the left or right, or upward or downward), and subsequently had to decide in what direction the probe had shifted. We used a staircase to adjust task difficulty (i.e., the distance between the memory item and probe). Bayesian repeated measures ANOVAs were used to compare left versus right eye movements and items in the left versus right visual field.
Results
In both conditions, patients with right PPC damage showed worse trans-saccadic memory performance compared to healthy control subjects (for the condition with left- and rightward gaze shifts, BF10~=~3.79; and when items were presented left or right, BF10~=~6.77), regardless of the direction of the gaze or the initial location of the memory item. At the individual level, none of the patients showed a direction specific deficit after leftward versus rightward saccades, whereas two patients showed worse performance for items in the left versus right visual field.
Conclusion
Damage in the right PPC did not lead to gaze direction specific impairments in trans-saccadic memory, but instead caused more general spatial memory impairments.},

Although the implications of this                     phenomenon have been widely studied, its underlying cause remains undetermined.                     One can learn not to explore because the environment is uncontrollable, because                     the average reinforcement for exploring is low, or because rewards for exploring                     are rare. In the current research, we tested a simple experimental paradigm that                     contrasts the predictions of these three contributors and offers a unified                     psychological mechanism that underlies the observed phenomena. Our results                     demonstrate that learned helplessness is not correlated with either the                     perceived controllability of one's environment or the average reward, which                     suggests that reward prevalence is a better predictor of exploratory behavior                     than the other two factors.

Using a person perception paradigm, we investigated gay men's ratings of targets who disclosed racial preferences in a mock online dating profile. Across three experiments, we found that participants generally rated the target as more racist, less attractive, less dateable, and were less personally willing to have relations with him if he disclosed racial preferences than if he did not. Even participants who believed that having racial preferences is not racist consistently rated a target disclosing racial preferences as more racist, largely less dateable, and were less personally willing to have relations with him. For these participants, however, racial preference disclosure had no reliable effect on how physically attractive they found the target. Findings suggest that disclosing racial preferences in the domain of attraction is interpreted as reflecting racism, even by those who ostensibly believe that people can have non-racist racial preferences.},

However, even in paradigms with zero risk of sanctions, individuals do not consistently cheat. Still more strikingly, most of the few findings available from studies implementing a sanctioning system run contrary to what would be expected based on utility-based accounts of dishonesty, showing increased cheating when there is a small risk of sanctions as compared to when the risk is zero. Given the striking nature of these findings and the general scarcity of corresponding evidence, we devised a targeted empirical test of the role of sanctions for dishonest behavior. Specifically, in two experiments, we manipulated the probability (i.e., 16.7\% vs. 50\%) that the factual truth of one's response in a cheating paradigm is checked. In Experiment 2, we further varied the severity of sanctions for being caught cheating. Results showed that the willingness to lie strongly decreased with increasing probability of being caught as well as with increasing severity of sanctions. As such, the results clearly support the theoretical notion that external costs influence unethical behavior, in the direction implied by utility-based models.},

Specifically, as proposed by the self?other knowledge asymmetry model, an incremental predictive ability of informants is most likely for traits and corresponding behaviours that are clearly visible to others and highly evaluative in nature. In two studies, we provide an empirical test of this proposition and extend prior research to one of the most important domains of interpersonal interaction: prosocial and moral behaviours. Specifically, we investigate the unique predictive power of informant reports in trait Honesty?Humility for fairness in the dictator game and dishonesty in a cheating paradigm. Importantly, while both these classes of behaviour are highly evaluative in nature, only fairness is clearly visible to others. Correspondingly, in line with the self?other knowledge asymmetry model, our results reveal unique predictive accuracy of informant reports for fairness. For dishonesty, by contrast, there was no conclusive evidence for incremental predictive power of informant reports. This implies that informants may indeed provide valuable information beyond targets' self?reports on trait aspects driving fair behaviour, but that targets themselves are their own best experts when it comes to judging trait aspects driving dishonest behaviour.

  abstract = {{$\gamma$}-Hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) is an endogenous compound proposed to act as a neurotransmitter. Na+-dependent, high-affinity GHB transport has long been considered important evidence supporting this hypothesis. However, the molecular identity of such a high-affinity transporter remains unknown. In this study, we sought to identify and characterize GHB synaptic transport through a series of studies using both native and recombinant systems with the ultimate aim of providing evidence to clarify the proposed role of GHB as a neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain. Native [3H]GHB transport was studied in isolated rat brain synaptosomes and compared to synaptic membranes. As a targeted approach, GHB was also screened against a panel of Na+-dependent SLC6 neurotransmitter transporters recombinantly expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes or tsA201 cells. Finally, the low-affinity GHB transporters, MCT1/2 and SMCT1, were probed as GHB transporters in L-[14C]lactate uptake assays in synaptosomes. We found no evidence of high-affinity [3H]GHB transport in purified rat brain cortical or striatal synaptosomes or at any of the 11 SLC6 transporters tested. Instead, our results indicate the binding of [3H]GHB to an unidentified membrane component, distinct from any of the known GHB targets. In accordance with others, we found that GHB and the analog 3-hydroxycyclopent-1-enecarboxylic acid (HOCPCA) can, in millimolar concentrations, inhibit L-[14C]lactate uptake at MCT1 and/or MCT2 and that this also can occur in synaptosomes. In conclusion, through a variety of in vitro pharmacological studies, we were unsuccessful in identifying a specific synaptic high-affinity transporter for GHB. Our findings emphasize the need to reevaluate GHB's role as a potential neurotransmitter.

We addressed this question using the steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP), which provides a discernible measure of visuocortical activation to multiple stimuli simultaneously. Fifty-six adults were asked to remember a set of two oriented gratings. During the retention interval, two frequency-tagged oriented gratings were presented to probe the visuocortical processing of matching versus mismatching orientations relative to the memory set. Matching probes prompted an increased visuocortical response, whereas mismatching stimuli were suppressed. This suggests that the visual cortex prioritizes attentional selection of memory-relevant features at the expense of non-memory-relevant features. When two memory items were probed simultaneously, visuocortical amplification alternated between the two stimuli at a rate of 3 Hz to 4 Hz, consistent with the rate of attentional sampling of sensory events from the external world. These results suggest a serial, single-item attentional sampling of remembered features.},

Longitudinal survey data were collected from 522 research assistants in 41 labs at six institutions. We used multilevel modeling, and results supported a socialization effect for URM students: The aggregate PABs of their lab mates predicted the students' own initial PABs, as well as their subsequent experiences of interest and their motivation to pursue a career in science, even after controlling for individual-level PABs. Results demonstrate that research labs serve as microcultures of information about the science norms and values that influence motivation. URM students are particularly sensitive to this information. Efforts to broaden participation should be informed by an understanding of the group processes that convey such prosocial values.},

Performance improved with the number of repeated-image presentations up to a ceiling around seven repetitions and was above chance even after only two to three presentations. The task was easiest for slow streams; performance dropped with increasing image-presentation rate but stabilized above 15 Hz and remained well above chance even at 120 Hz.

To investigate this question, we analyzed gender distributions in publicly available federal funding data from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada that are specific to cognitive psychology and cognitive neuroscience. There were three key results. First, the proportion of women cognitive scientists progressively diminished at each career stage, particularly at the transition between graduate and postdoctoral studies. Second, female principal investigators (PI) received smaller average Discovery Grant amounts and were less likely to receive Discovery Accelerator Supplements as a proportion of all Discovery Grants funded. Finally, at the PI level, gender differences were relatively smaller for institution-initiated grants (i.e., Canada Research Chairs) versus investigator-initiated grants (i.e., Discovery Grants). It is our hope that presentation of such data, in concert with other recent reports for our field (e.g., Klatzky, Holt, \& Behrmann, 2015; Peelle, 2016; Vaid \& Geraci, 2016), continues to raise awareness that gender parity issues remain a concern that deserves ongoing attention within the field of cognitive science in Canada.

  abstract = {We examine a fundamental feature of choice under uncertainty: Overestimating an alternative makes one more likely to choose it. If people are naive to this structural feature, then they will tend to have erroneously inflated expectations for the alternatives they choose. In contrast to theories of motivated reasoning, this theory suggests that individuals will overestimate chosen alternatives even before they make their choice. In four studies, we found that students and managers exhibited behavior consistent with na\"ivet\'e toward this relationship between estimation error and choice, leaving them overoptimistic about their chosen alternatives. This overoptimism from choosing positive error is exacerbated when the true values of the alternatives are close together, when there is more uncertainty about the values of alternatives, and when there are many alternatives to choose from. Our results illustrate how readily overoptimism emerges as a result of statistical na\"ivet\'e, even in the absence of a desire to justify one's decision after the choice.},

This study is a conceptual replication and extension of Sonbul and Schmitt's research. Sixty-two advanced English as a second language (ESL) speakers read texts containing repeated occurrences of low-frequency medical collocations in three sessions over 2 days. The incidental learning treatments included reading only (no typographic enhancement), bolding, and bolding-plus-glossing. Collocational knowledge was assessed in tests of explicit knowledge (cued recall, form recognition) and a test of implicit knowledge (primed lexical decision). Repeated exposure to bolded collocations produced greater explicit knowledge than repeated exposure to typographically unenhanced collocations. Evidence of implicit knowledge development was observed in the unenhanced (reading only) treatment but not in the remaining treatments. These results replicated Sonbul and Schmitt's findings for explicit knowledge and extended their findings for implicit knowledge. Open Practices This article has been awarded an Open Materials badge.

The present study addressed the question of whether this efficiency scales up to dyads working together to achieve a shared goal: Do people act efficiently as a group (i.e., coefficiently), or do they minimize their own or their partner's individual costs even if this increases the overall cost for the group? We devised a novel, touch-screen-based, sequential object-transfer task to measure how people choose between different paths to coordinate with a partner. Across multiple experiments, we found that participants did not simply minimize their own or their partner's movement costs but made coefficient decisions about paths, which ensured that the aggregate costs of movement for the dyad were minimized. These results suggest that people are able and motivated to make coefficient, collectively rational decisions when acting together.},

In Study 1 (N = 179), UAPs, on average, related to greater negative-affect versus positive-affect induction helping tactics. In two experiments, UAPs, on average, related to a greater likelihood of selecting anger-inducing versus love-inducing or sadness-inducing songs to help a target overcome a breakup (Study 2; N = 313) and greater selection of anger-inducing and hubris-inducing messages versus authentic-pride-inducing and love-inducing messages to help a teammate struggling in a game (Study 3; N = 246). UCPs manifested the opposite patterns. Generally, these associations corresponded with helping-strategy utility beliefs and were robust to moderators of helping target (self or other; Study 2) or altruistic versus selfish motives (Study 3). Study 4 (N = 205) provided some evidence of ecological validity in contexts of recalled everyday helping. Associations between personality constructs and relative helping strategies were about moderate in size (rs .20) across these four studies. Findings suggest that UAPs are associated with helping strategies believed to promote `contemptuous' self-enhancement relative to `innocuous' self-enhancement and self-transcendence, and vice versa for UCPs. \textcopyright{} 2019 European Association of Personality Psychology},

  abstract = {Research has shown that contoids (phonetically defined consonants) may provide more robust and reliable cues to syllable and word boundaries than vocoids (phonetically defined vowels). Recent studies of Danish, a language characterized by frequent long sequences of vocoids in speech, have suggested that the reduced occurrence of contoids may make speech in it intrinsically harder to segment than in closely related languages such as Norwegian. We addressed this hypothesis empirically in an artificial language learning experiment with native speakers of Danish, Norwegian, and English. We tested whether artificial speech consisting of concatenated contoid?vocoid syllables is easier to segment than speech consisting of vocoid?vocoid syllables where the first segment is a semivowel and the second a full vowel. Contrary to what was expected, we found no effect of the phonetic makeup of the syllables on speech segmentability. Possible interpretations and implications of this result are discussed.

The phonological plausibility of children's spellings, particularly their spellings of the words' first phonemes, was higher for letter-name words than for control words. When we categorized spelling performance in a session as prephonological if the child used phonologically appropriate letters no more often than would be expected by chance, we found that children were more likely to be prephonological spellers in the session with control words than in the session with letter-name words. Words with letter names can help children move from prephonological spellings to spellings that symbolize at least some of the sounds in words.},

If mutual friends self-disclose today, will they receive more social support 6 months later? In turn, will this affect their willingness to self-disclose another 6 months later? We further analyzed spill-over effects from face-to-face to IM communication and vice versa. We found that self-disclosure predicted social support and vice versa in IM communication, but not in face-to-face communication. In light of these results, the impact of IM communication on how individuals maneuver friendships through the interplay between selfdisclosure and social support are discussed.},

  abstract = {Antiepileptogenic agents that prevent the development of epilepsy following a brain insult remain the holy grail of epilepsy therapeutics. We have employed a label-free proteomic approach that allows quantification of large numbers of brain-expressed proteins in a single analysis in the mouse (male C57BL/6J) kainate (KA) model of epileptogenesis. In addition, we have incorporated two putative antiepileptogenic drugs, postsynaptic density protein-95 blocking peptide (PSD95BP or Tat-NR2B9c) and a highly selective inducible nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, 1400W, to give an insight into how such agents might ameliorate epileptogenesis. The test drugs were administered after the induction of status epilepticus (SE) and the animals were euthanized at 7 days, their hippocampi removed, and subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis. A total of 2,579 proteins were identified; their normalized abundance was compared between treatment groups using ANOVA, with correction for multiple testing by false discovery rate. Significantly altered proteins were subjected to gene ontology and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses. KA-induced SE was most robustly associated with an alteration in the abundance of proteins involved in neuroinflammation, including heat shock protein beta-1 (HSP27), glial fibrillary acidic protein, and CD44 antigen. Treatment with PSD95BP or 1400W moderated the abundance of several of these proteins plus that of secretogranin and Src substrate cortactin. Pathway analysis identified the glutamatergic synapse as a key target for both drugs. Our observations require validation in a larger-scale investigation, with candidate proteins explored in more detail. Nevertheless, this study has identified several mechanisms by which epilepsy might develop and several targets for novel drug development. Open Practices This article has been awarded Open Data.

Moderation tests revealed greater effects in settings that served tastier vegetable recipes.

But, surprisingly, when considering specific examples of unintentional, blameless rule-breaking, approximately half of people judge that no rule was broken. This effect, known as excuse validation, has previously been observed in American adults. Outstanding questions concern what causes excuse validation, and whether it is peculiar to American moral psychology or cross-culturally robust. The present paper studies the phenomenon cross-culturally, focusing on Korean and American adults, and proposes a new explanation of why people engage in excuse validation, in terms of competing forces in human norm-psychology. The principal findings are that Americans and Koreans engaged in excuse validation at similar levels, and older adults were more likely to engage in excuse validation.

  abstract = {People tend to judge what is typical as also good and appropriate\textemdash as what ought to be. What accounts for the prevalence of these judgments, given that their validity is at best uncertain? We hypothesized that the tendency to reason from ``is'' to ``ought'' is due in part to a systematic bias in people's (nonmoral) explanations, whereby regularities (e.g., giving roses on Valentine's Day) are explained predominantly via inherent or intrinsic facts (e.g., roses are beautiful). In turn, these inherence-biased explanations lead to value-laden downstream conclusions (e.g., it is good to give roses). Consistent with this proposal, results from five studies (N = 629 children and adults) suggested that, from an early age, the bias toward inherence in explanations fosters inferences that imbue observed reality with value. Given that explanations fundamentally determine how people understand the world, the bias toward inherence in these judgments is likely to exert substantial influence over sociomoral understanding.},

We synthesized and quantitatively analyzed 45 effect sizes from 26 studies (N = 1,918) to calculate the mean effect size of the frequency\textendash learning relationship and to explore the extent to which 10 empirically motivated variables moderate this relationship. Results showed that there was a medium effect (r = .34) of repetition on incidental vocabulary learning. Subsequent moderator analyses revealed that variability in the size of repetition effects across studies was explained by learner variables (age, vocabulary knowledge), treatment variables (spaced learning, visual support, engagement, range in number of encounters), and methodological differences (nonword use, forewarning of an upcoming comprehension test, vocabulary test format). Based on the findings, we suggest future directions for L2 incidental vocabulary learning research. Open Practices This article has been awarded an Open Data badge.

In contrast to previous work which suggests that empathy does not shape the perceptions of injustice, the present research proposes that while perceptions of fairness in the context of injustice are dynamic, they may well be shaped by empathy. Using a dictator-style paradigm, the present research explored the extent to which empathy is related to perceptions of injustice and in turn, compensating forms of inequality. A non-registered Study 1 (N = 466) found that higher empathy predisposition is related to perceiving more injustice in contexts of inequality. Preregistered Study 2 (N = 406) extended this finding by experimentally manipulating empathy, showing that emphasising with the victim of inequality is indirectly related to perceiving injustice. The hypothesised mechanism, empathy allowing identification and experiencing the feelings of anger associated with the injustice, is supported in Study 2. As such, perceptions of fairness are not static; empathy is argued to be an important mechanism in forming justice perceptions.

  abstract = {Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disorder that results from motor neuron damage. Cannabinoids have been proposed as treatments for ALS because of their anti-excitotoxicity, anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Preclinical studies in mice models of ALS have been published using a range of cannabinoid formulations and doses. To date, there has been no rigorous evaluation of these trials to assess a potential cannabinoid treatment effect. This review and meta-analysis was undertaken to provide evidence for or against a treatment effect of cannabinoids in murine ALS models. Evidence of a treatment effect in mice may provide motivation for trials in human ALS. We identified a total of 10 studies; nine studies using cannabinoid treatment in transgenic SOD1-G93A ALS-model mice and one study in TDP-43 transgenic mice. Eight of the nine studies that used SOD1-G93A mice expressed similarly high copy numbers of the transgene while one study used a low-copy number line. Outcomes evaluated were survival time and disease progression. The latter was measured by motor function and bodyweight decline. Meta-analysis of the mean difference in survival time across the seven studies showed an increase in survival of 3.84 days (95\% CI: 0.35\textendash 7.32 days; p = 0.031) for cannabinoid treated compared to control SOD1-G93A mice. It was not possible to conduct meta-analyses for motor function decline or weight loss. However, eight of nine studies reported significant improvements in measures of motor function decline and one reported non-significant improvements. Weight loss was significantly attenuated in four of five studies reporting this measure while the other study reported a non-significant attenuation. This review provides some evidence for the efficacy of cannabinoids in prolonging survival time in an ALS mouse model. A delay in disease progression is also suggested following cannabinoid treatment though it was not possible to consolidate the results from reviewed studies. However, studies have moderate to high risk of bias and are highly heterogeneous. Although this review provides some evidence to support the conduct of a cannabinoid trial in human ALS, more standardized studies on specific cannabinoids are necessary before supporting therapeutic potential of cannabinoids in treating patients with ALS.

  abstract = {Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) may be marked by an altered balance between sensory input and prior expectations. Because many illusions rely on integrating sensory input with prior information such as spatial context, individuals with ASD may therefore be less susceptible to visual illusions than typically developing (TD) individuals. Yet empirical evidence on the matter is rather divergent, varying depending on the type of illusion, study procedure, and population. Visual illusions lead to neural activity alterations in the visual system. In the so-called Kanizsa illusion, these are likely caused by top-down feedback to V1. Here we tested the hypothesis that a reduced susceptibility to illusions in ASD would manifest as diminished modulation of V1 activity by illusions, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We presented 22 adolescents with ASD and 22 age-, gender-, and intelligence-matched TD controls with displays that consisted of three circular inducers. These either formed an illusory triangle (Kanizsa illusion) or not. We identified regions in primary visual cortex (V1) that corresponded to (the visual field locations of) the illusory triangle and its inducers, and recorded their visual response. Previous research in healthy volunteers has shown a specific pattern of up- and down-regulation in regions of V1 that process the shape and inducers, respectively. Here, we replicated this pattern of up- and downregulation in V1, in both the TD and ASD groups, with no differences between groups. This suggests that illusory shape processing in primary visual cortex is equally present in ASD, suggesting unimpaired processing of spatial context.},

  abstract = {The ability to anticipate events and execute motor commands prior to a sensory event is an essential capability for human's everyday life. This implicitly learned anticipatory behavior depends on the past performance of repeated sensorimotor interactions timed with external cues. This kind of predictive behavior has been shown to be compromised in neurological disorders such as Huntington disease (HD), in which neural atrophy includes key cortical and basal ganglia regions. To investigate the neural basis of the anticipatory behavioral deficits in HD we used a predictive-saccade paradigm that requires predictive control to generate saccades in a metronomic temporal pattern. This is ideal because the integrity of the oculomotor network that includes the striatum and prefrontal, parietal, occipital and temporal cortices can be analyzed using structural MRI. Our results showed that the HD patients had severe predictive saccade deficits (i.e., an inability to reduce saccade reaction time in predictive condition), which are accentuated in patients with more severe motor deterioration. Structural imaging analyses revealed that these anticipatory deficits correlated with grey-matter atrophy in frontal, parietal-occipital and striatal regions. These findings indicate that the predictive saccade control deficits in HD are related to an extended cortico-striatal atrophy. This suggests that eye movement measurement could be a reliable marker of the progression of cognitive deficits in HD.},

To present ego depletion as more than a convenient metaphor, some researchers have proposed that glucose is the limited resource that becomes depleted with self-control. However, there have been theoretical challenges to the proposed glucose mechanism, and the experiments that have tested it have found mixed results. We used a new meta-analytic tool, p-curve analysis, to examine the reliability of the evidence from these experiments. We found that the effect sizes reported in this literature are possibly influenced by publication or reporting bias and that, even within studies yielding significant results, the evidential value of this research is weak. In light of these results, and pending further evidence, researchers and policymakers should refrain from drawing any conclusions about the role of glucose in self-control.},

One explanation is that people humanize their ingroup to bolster their social identity in the face of their mortality. Alternatively, people might be motivated to see their ingroup as more uniquely human (UH) to distance themselves from their corporeal ``animal'' nature. These explanations were tested in Australia, where social identity is tied less to UH and more to human nature (HN) which does not distinguish humans from animals. Australians attributed more HN traits to the ingroup when mortality was salient, while the attribution of UH traits remained unchanged. This indicates that the mortality-buffering function of ingroup humanization lies in reinforcing the humanness of our social identity, rather than just distancing ourselves from our animal nature. Implications for (de)humanization in intergroup relations are discussed.},

In Study 1 (n = 263), participants indicated their relative intrinsic (vs. extrinsic) goal orientation (RIGO), were randomly assigned to either an MS or uncertainty salience condition, and rated their satisfaction with life. Study 2 (n = 389) was a preregistered follow-up, with the additional measurement of self-esteem and the MS comparison condition changed from uncertainty salience to a more neutral condition. Both studies found that: at low RIGO, MS (vs. comparison condition) decreased satisfaction with life; however, at high RIGO, MS increased satisfaction with life. Study 2 further found that the moderating role of RIGO was not due to its association with self-esteem, but also failed to replicate prior evidence suggesting self-esteem moderates the effect of MS on satisfaction with life. These findings inform the impact of death awareness on well-being, highlighting the role of value orientations in whether death awareness is taken as an unpleasant existential stressor or an occasion to reflect on life with greater satisfaction.},

To date, only a very small fraction of these data have been digitized as part of the MIDAS dataset, and exclusively after 1950. Using the recently-scanned UK Met Office Monthly Weather Reports (MWR), which are based on a subset of the observations that form the DWR, we here provide digitized data and a summary of thunderdays from 10 long-running British stations over the period 1884\textendash 1993. The data are presented `as is', with no attempt to provide any corrections or calibration. For 4 of the 10 stations, thunderday observations were discontinued at various times between 1949 and 1964, and it is necessary to switch to a neighbouring station in order to continue the series. Approximately half the series exhibit sharp drops in thunderdays at various points between 1960 and 1990, although none are coincident with known station changes. Comparison with nearby MIDAS stations suggests the low thunderdays are the result of changes in observing practice, rather than genuine changes in thunderstorm occurrence. These potential data issues limit interpretation of the long-term trends. However, it can nevertheless be concluded that none of the stations show the expected increase in thunderdays as a result of the rise in surface temperature over the 20th century. In order to provide more quantitative determination of the long-term trends in thunderstorm occurrence, we advocate further digitization efforts to recover the data from the numerous stations in the MWRs, and subsequent analysis of the common signals across neighbouring stations.},

We found typical prior-based performance improvements irrespective of ASD-like traits or ASD diagnosis, suggesting that the fast formation and application of specific priors is preserved in ASD. Together with earlier studies reporting intact use of other types of perceptual priors, these findings narrow down the candidate Bayesian accounts that are plausible for ASD.},

We compared the effect of memory retrieval and context inferences on short- and long-term retention in three experiments. Participants studied novel words and then practiced the words either in an uninformative context that required the retrieval of word meaning from memory (?I need the funguo?) or in an informative context from which word meaning could be inferred (?I want to unlock the door: I need the funguo?). The informative context facilitated word comprehension during practice. However, later recall of word form and meaning and word recognition in a new context were better after successful retrieval practice and retrieval practice with feedback than after context-inference practice. These findings suggest benefits of retrieval during contextualized vocabulary learning whereby the uninformative context enhanced word retention by triggering memory retrieval.

  abstract = {Speech prosody, the variation in sentence melody and rhythm, plays a crucial role in sentence comprehension. Specifically, changes in intonational pitch along a sentence can affect our understanding of who did what to whom. To date, it remains unclear how the brain processes this particular use of intonation and which brain regions are involved. In particular, one central matter of debate concerns the lateralisation of intonation processing. To study the role of intonation in sentence comprehension, we designed a functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) experiment in which participants listened to spoken sentences. Critically, the interpretation of these sentences depended on either intonational or grammatical cues. Our results showed stronger functional activity in the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) when the intonational cue was crucial for sentence comprehension compared to when it was not. When instead a grammatical cue was crucial for sentence comprehension, we found involvement of an overlapping region in the left IFG, as well as in a posterior temporal region. A further analysis revealed that the lateralisation of intonation processing depends on its role in syntactic processing: activity in the IFG was lateralised to the left hemisphere when intonation was the only source of information to comprehend the sentence. In contrast, activity in the IFG was right-lateralised when intonation did not contribute to sentence comprehension. Together, these results emphasise the key role of the left IFG in sentence comprehension, showing the importance of this region when intonation establishes sentence structure. Furthermore, our results provide evidence for the theory that the lateralisation of prosodic processing is modulated by its linguistic role.},

  abstract = {We sometimes evaluate our environment (e.g., persons, objects, situations) in an automatic fashion. These automatic or implicit evaluations are often considered to be based on qualitatively distinct mental processes compared with more controlled or explicit evaluations. Important evidence for this claim comes from studies showing that implicit evaluations do not change as the result of counterattitudinal information, in contrast to their explicit counterparts. We examined the impact of counterattitudinal information on implicit evaluations in two experiments (N = 60, N = 72) that included an innovative manipulation: hypnotic suggestions to participants that they would strongly process upcoming counterattitudinal information. Both experiments indicated that hypnotic suggestions facilitated effects of counterattitudinal information on implicit evaluations. These findings extend recent evidence for rapid revision of implicit evaluations on the basis of counterattitudinal information and support the controversial idea that belief-based processes underlie not only explicit but also implicit evaluations.},

Moreover, general distinctiveness had unique predictive value over commitment strength. Comparative distinctiveness from important others uniquely indicated lowered social well-being.

A largely unanswered question concerns the extent to which self-control changes across the lifespan and in response to major life events. The present research used prospective four-wave data from 539 Dutch individuals to examine the self-control trajectory of first-time parents (n~=~246) as compared with individuals who did not have children during the research period (n~=~293). New parents (especially mothers) reported higher levels of self-control before birth (i.e. during pregnancy) than did nonparents. New mothers showed significant non-linear decreases in self-control, which were especially strong from pregnancy until 6~months after childbirth. New fathers' self-control remained largely stable. Furthermore, pregnancy-related stress was associated with lower self-control levels during pregnancy in both first-time mothers and fathers. Higher levels of work?family conflict and family-related stress were associated with lower self-control after childbirth in new fathers, but not in new mothers. These results indicate that major life transitions may be linked to changes in adult self-control. Discussion focuses on the implications of the results for theory and research on the development of self-control in adulthood.},

Instead of in-kind reciprocity\textemdash an eye for an eye\textemdash negative reciprocity may escalate, taking two eyes for an eye. We tested two competing mechanisms for negative escalation using a modified dictator game that reliably produces escalating reciprocity to others' negative actions but not to positive actions. According to one mechanism, escalation is strategic: a deliberate attempt to deter future harm. According to another mechanism, escalation is reflexive: an impulsive act of retribution without consideration of future consequences. In seven experiments, we find clear evidence consistent with a reflexive mechanism. Encouraging deliberation reduced negative escalation in one-shot interactions as well as in repeated interactions. Focusing on future consequences decreased escalation whereas disabling deliberation increased escalation. Finally, the explicit goal to punish another's negative behavior increased escalation while the goal of deterring future transgressions did not. These experiments suggest that escalation is a reflexive form of punishment rather than a deliberate act of strategic deterrence. Encouraging, enabling, or training deliberative processes may effectively reduce costly escalation in everyday life.},

While such distraction is typically regarded as potentially important in everyday life, previous work has so far not examined how deviant sounds affect performance on more complex daily tasks. In this study, we developed a new method to examine whether deviant sounds can disrupt reading performance by recording participants' eye movements. Participants read single sentences in silence and while listening to task-irrelevant sounds. In the latter condition, a 50-ms sound was played contingent on the fixation of five target words in the sentence. On most occasions, the same tone was presented (standard sound), whereas on rare and unexpected occasions it was replaced by white noise (deviant sound). The deviant sound resulted in significantly longer fixation durations on the target words relative to the standard sound. A time-course analysis showed that the deviant sound began to affect fixation durations around 180\,ms after fixation onset. Furthermore, deviance distraction was not modulated by the lexical frequency of target words. In summary, fixation durations on the target words were longer immediately after the presentation of the deviant sound, but there was no evidence that it interfered with the lexical processing of these words. The present results are in line with the recent proposition that deviant sounds yield a temporary motor suppression and suggest that deviant sounds likely inhibit the programming of the next saccade.},

Participants in the phonological specificity training (with phonological manipulation) and the picture selection (without phonological manipulation) experimental conditions had to select the corresponding picture from among competitors after hearing a word. Phonological specificity training resulted in increased learning (measured through word translation) compared to the control condition on the posttest whereas picture selection produced increased learning only for participants with larger initial vocabulary sizes. Both experimental conditions showed increased learning for participants with larger vocabulary sizes on the retention test. Compared to picture selection, phonological specificity training showed more learning immediately after intervention for words with nonnative contrasts. Results suggest that phonological features can augment (meaning-focused) L2 vocabulary learning interventions. Open Practices This article has been awarded an Open Materials badge.

  abstract = {Abstract For more than 150~years, it is known that occupational overexposure of manganese (Mn) causes movement disorders resembling Parkinson's disease (PD) and PD-like syndromes. However, the mechanisms of Mn toxicity are still poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that Mn dose- and time-dependently blocks the protein translation of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and heavy-chain Ferritin (H-Ferritin), both iron homeostatic proteins with neuroprotective features. APP and H-Ferritin are post-transcriptionally regulated by iron responsive proteins, which bind to homologous iron responsive elements (IREs) located in the 5?-untranslated regions (5?-UTRs) within their mRNA transcripts. Using reporter assays, we demonstrate that Mn exposure repressed the 5?-UTR-activity of APP and H-Ferritin, presumably via increased iron responsive proteins-iron responsive elements binding, ultimately blocking their protein translation. Using two specific Fe2+-specific probes (RhoNox-1 and IP-1) and ion chromatography inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (IC-ICP-MS), we show that loss of the protective axis of APP and H-Ferritin resulted in unchecked accumulation of redox-active ferrous iron (Fe2+) fueling neurotoxic oxidative stress. Enforced APP expression partially attenuated Mn-induced generation of cellular and lipid reactive oxygen species and neurotoxicity. Lastly, we could validate the Mn-mediated suppression of APP and H-Ferritin in two rodent in~vivo models (C57BL6/N mice and RjHan:SD rats) mimicking acute and chronic Mn exposure. Together, these results suggest that Mn-induced neurotoxicity is partly attributable to the translational inhibition of APP and H-Ferritin resulting in impaired iron metabolism and exacerbated neurotoxic oxidative stress.

This paper focuses on gravity data acquired after 1971, which marks the adoption of IGSN71 as a reference for the world network by the International Association of Geodesy (IAG). Next to a complete dataset containing all Belgian gravity data, the available gravity data were reduced to the corresponding measurement campaign, enabling determination of specific metadata (e.g. used gravimeter, tide system parameters, time of acquisition, etc.). New gravity and spirit levelling measurements were executed by the Royal Observatory Belgium and the National Geographic Institute (Federal Mapping Agency) to validate the g-value at the historical reference base station `Carte du Ciel' in Brussels. Taking into account the instrumental errors and the varying ground water content, the retrieved data are validated and approved for use in further research.},

In the current study, we examined corticospinal excitability and behavioral performance in a go/no-go task. Go and no-go trials were presented in runs of five, and go and no-go runs alternated predictably. At the beginning of each trial, subjects indicated whether they expected a go trial or a no-go trial. Analyses revealed that subjects immediately adjusted their expectancy ratings when a new run started. However, motor excitability was primarily associated with the properties of the previous trial, rather than the predicted properties of the current trial. We also observed a large latency cost at the beginning of a go run (i.e., reaction times were longer for the first trial in a go run than for the second trial). These findings indicate that actions in predictable environments are substantially influenced by previous events, even if this influence conflicts with conscious expectancies about upcoming events.},

The present study examined how children and adolescents structured tasks and implemented rules when novel task instructions were presented in a child-friendly version of a novel instruction-learning paradigm.

Before this mapping could be implemented, subjects had to make responses in order to advance through screens during a preparatory (``next'') phase. Children (4\textendash 11 years old) and late adolescents (17\textendash 19 years old) responded more slowly during the next phase when the next response was incompatible with the instructed stimulus-response mapping. This instruction-based interference effect was more pronounced in young children than in older children. We argue that these findings are most consistent with age-related differences in rule structuring. We discuss the implications of our findings for theories of rule-based performance, instruction-based learning, and development.},

How do these prior biases interact with new experiences when learning about individual group members' trustworthiness? These three studies are the first to examine the effect of group-level biases on learning about individuals' trustworthiness. Participants from the Netherlands and the United Kingdom played iterated Trust Games with trustworthy and untrustworthy members of both ingroups and outgroups. We show that the influence of group membership on trust decisions depended on the valence of the interactions with individual group members. When interacting with trustworthy partners, people displayed outgroup favouritism throughout the game, investing higher in outgroup members than ingroup members. However, for untrustworthy partners, initial outgroup favouritism disappeared, and ingroup and outgroup members were equally distrusted by the end of the game. Our work suggests that when individual experience is integrated with group-based biases, group membership influences trust decisions over time, but mostly when experiences are positive. These findings are discussed in relation to complexity-extremity theory and previous work on learning in the Trust Game.},

Mazar, Amir, and Ariely (2008, Experiment 1) gave participants an opportunity and incentive to cheat on a problem-solving task. Prior to that task, participants either recalled the Ten Commandments (a moral reminder) or recalled 10 books they had read in high school (a neutral task). Results were consistent with the self-concept maintenance theory. When given the opportunity to cheat, participants given the moral-reminder priming task reported solving 1.45 fewer matrices than did those given a neutral prime (Cohen's d = 0.48); moral reminders reduced cheating. Mazar et al.'s article is among the most cited in deception research, but their Experiment 1 has not been replicated directly. This Registered Replication Report describes the aggregated result of 25 direct replications (total N = 5,786), all of which followed the same preregistered protocol. In the primary meta-analysis (19 replications, total n = 4,674), participants who were given an opportunity to cheat reported solving 0.11 more matrices if they were given a moral reminder than if they were given a neutral reminder (95\% confidence interval = [-0.09, 0.31]). This small effect was numerically in the opposite direction of the effect observed in the original study (Cohen's d = -0.04).},

When role demands to maximize candidate fit in hiring selections were strong, preference for job candidates of a given group tended to be lower when there were cues to third-party prejudice against that group (vs. no cues), irrespective of in-group favoritism effects (Studies 1\textendash 5) or participant attitudes (Studies 4 and 5). We found supporting evidence for the underlying processes in the context of hiring selections involving fictional groups (Study 1) as well as female job candidates (Studies 2\textendash 5). A concern with meeting the demands of the gatekeeper role was at the root of prejudice accommodation: When role-demands to prioritize candidate fit were strong, role-relevant considerations (interpersonal and task-focused) mediated the accommodation effect (Studies 1 and 4). The more gatekeepers in charge of hiring sought to meet role demands by considering the preferences of relevant third parties, the more they accommodated third-party prejudice (Study 2). Moreover, role-based concerns mediated the accommodation of prejudice\textemdash but not other potential considerations that were unrelated to role demands (Study 3). Finally, the accommodation effect was eliminated when the role definition did not prioritize candidate fit (Study 4) and when we experimentally reduced the strength of role-related concerns (Study 5). These findings illustrate the relevance of the role concept for understanding the social transmission of bias.},

It is also a period of concurrent endocrine and physical changes associated with puberty. A growing body of research suggests that hormonal shifts during adolescence impact brain development, but minimal research in humans has examined the relationship between intra-individual changes in puberty and brain function. The current study examines linear and nonlinear changes in affective reactivity in a longitudinal sample of 82 adolescents who underwent three fMRI sessions between the ages of 9 and 18 years. Changes in response to affective facial stimuli were related to age, pubertal stage, and testosterone levels. Using multilevel modeling, we highlight extensive nonlinear development of socio-emotional responsivity across the brain. Results include mid-pubertal peaks in amygdala and hippocampus response to fearful expressions, as well as sex differences in regions subserving social and self-evaluative processes. However, testosterone levels exhibited inverse patterns of association with neural response compared to pubertal stage in females (e.g., U-shaped relationship with the amygdala and hippocampus). Findings highlight potentially unique roles of age, pubertal stage and testosterone on socio-emotional development during adolescence, as well as sex differences in these associations.},

We leverage 10 high-quality representative datasets to compare the representative samples with the two subsamples.

Accordingly, one might expect that ideological uncertainty would lead individuals to engage more deeply with the political domain in order to acquire a sufficient level of subjective certainty that the ideological orientation they have adopted is the ``right'' one. Given the inherent complexity and ambiguity of the political realm, however, we propose that ideological uncertainty should instead undermine political efficacy and interest, thereby motivating individuals to disengage and withdrawal from participating in electoral politics. Using both correlational and experimental methods, we conduct four studies on both convenience and representative samples in the context of two electoral contexts to test this hypothesis. Study 1 (N = 343) and Study 2 (N = 1054) demonstrate that ideological uncertainty covaries with reduced levels of political engagement and participation in the 2012 and 2016 U.S. Presidential Election, respectively. Study 3 (N = 170) and Study 4 (N = 798) replicate and extend the results of Study 1 and 2 by experimentally manipulating ideological uncertainty using an original and innovative false-feedback paradigm. We demonstrate the causal effect of ideological uncertainty on political engagement (independent of demographic variables, political knowledge, and ideological extremity and conviction), and find that it is particularly pronounced among individuals who reflect on the meaning of their political judgment and behaviors for their political orientation. Implications for political choice and behavior are considered.},

These issues have been the focus of recent debate within the research literature on the Dark Triad, which is a collection of interrelated but theoretically distinct personality constructs made up of narcissism, Machiavellianism and psychopathy. The present paper highlights previous work on the issue of partialling and also makes use of recent developments surrounding meta?analytic structural equation modelling to reliably assess the impact of partialling on the empirical profiles of the Dark Triad components. The results show that numerous interpretive difficulties arise after partialling the overlap among the Dark Triad components, most notably for narcissism and Machiavellianism. The results are discussed in the context of contemporary Dark Triad research in addition to discussing the implications for structural equation modelling methods in personality psychology more generally. Recommendations are made for how future research can mitigate the interpretive difficulties that may arise from partialling. Copyright ? 2018 European Association of Personality Psychology},

Judgements regarding hierarchical orderings tend to be faster and more accurate when the dominant element in any pair from the order (e.g., the older, richer) is presented on the left of the screen as compared with the right (left-anchoring effect). This signature effect is investigated in three conditions (Experiment 1), each implementing a different timing regime for the elements in each pair, during learning. Thereby, the construction of a mental representation of the ordering was exposed to a potentially competing spatial simulation, that is, the well-known ``mental timeline'' with orientation from left (present) to right (future). First, the left-anchoring effect for order representations remained significant when timeline information was congruent with the presumed left-anchoring process, that is, the dominant element in a pair was always presented first. Second, the same effect remained also significant when the timeline-related information was random, that is, the dominant element being presented either first or second. Third, the same effect was found to be still significant, when the timeline-related information was contrary to the left-anchoring process, that is, the dominant element being presented always second. Experiment 2 replicates the target effect under random timeline information, controlling for colour as a stimulus feature. The results are discussed in the context of a theoretical model that integrates basic assumptions about acquired reading/writing habits as a scaffold for spatial simulation and primacy/dominance representation within such spatial simulations.},

However, there are competing views on whether financial incentives stimulate coproduction. While some argue that financial incentives increase citizens' willingness to coproduce, others suggest that incentives decrease their willingness (i.e., crowding out). To test these competing expectations, the authors designed a set of experiments that offered subjects a financial incentive to assist municipalities in helping refugees integrate. The experiment was first conducted among university students within a laboratory setting. Then, the initial findings were replicated and extended among a general adult sample. Results suggest that small financial rewards have no effect: they neither increase nor decrease people's willingness to coproduce.

  abstract = {We meta-analyzed the effectiveness of incidental second language word learning from spoken input. Our sample contained 105 effect sizes from 32 primary studies employing meaning-focused word-learning activities with 1,964 participants with typical cognitive functioning. The random-effects meta-analysis yielded a mean effect size of g = 1.05, reflecting generally large vocabulary gains from spoken input in meaning-focused activities. A meta-regression with three substantive and two methodological predictors also revealed that adult participants outperformed children in terms of word learning and that interactive learning tasks were more effective than noninteractive ones. Furthermore, learning scores were higher when measured with recognition than with recall tests. Methodologically, the use of a no-input control group seemed to protect against an overestimation of learning effects, evidenced by smaller effect sizes. Finally, whether a pretest\textendash posttest design was used did not influence effect sizes. All data and the analysis script are publicly available.

In a recent longitudinal study, Lai and colleagues (2016, Study 2) compared nine interventions intended to reduce racial bias across 18 university campuses. Although all interventions changed participants' bias on an immediate test, none were effective after a delay. This study has been interpreted as strong evidence that implicit biases are difficult to change. We revisited Lai et al.'s study to test whether the stability observed reflected persistent individual attitudes or stable environments. Our reanalysis (N = 4,842) indicates that individual biases did not return to preexisting levels. Instead, campus means returned to preexisting campus means, whereas individual scores fluctuated mostly randomly. Campus means were predicted by markers of structural inequality. Our results are consistent with the theory that implicit bias reflects biases in the environment rather than individual dispositions. This conclusion is nearly the opposite of the original interpretation: Although social environments are stable, individual implicit biases are ephemeral.},

In this study, we investigate the statistical learning of adjacent and nonadjacent dependencies under low intervening variability using a modified serial reaction time (SRT) task. Young adults were trained on mixed sets of materials comprising equally probable adjacent and nonadjacent dependencies. Offline tests administered after training showed better performance for adjacent than nonadjacent dependencies. However, online SRT data indicated that the participants developed sensitivity to both types of dependencies during training, with no significant differences between dependency types. The results demonstrate the value of online measures of learning and suggest that adjacent and nonadjacent learning can occur together even when there is low variability in the intervening material.},

We extend our findings to a workplace context, and show that threatened individuals who lie on a job application feel more capable than those who report them honestly (Study 4). Finally, consistent with the argument that counterfeit competence is driven by self-protection, we find individuals do not predict they would experience such a boost (Study 5), and that cheating after threat offers benefits similar to those provided by other established methods of self-protection (Study 6). Together, our findings suggest that, after threat, misrepresenting one's performance can function as a mechanism that helps to restore positive self-evaluations about one's capabilities.},

  abstract = {The extent to which socially excluded individuals are willing to collaborate with others is an important theoretical and practical question. We consider four contrasting predictions based on the existing psychological literature. The first two are derived from the need-threat literature: Following social rejection individuals may withdraw from cooperative interaction in general (aggression hypothesis), or cooperate more in general (reconnection hypothesis). Alternatively, performance of the excluded individuals in cooperative tasks may worsen reflecting reduced ability to deliberate (cognitive depletion hypothesis). Finally, excluded individuals may cooperate less with those who rejected them (revenge hypothesis). We tested these hypotheses in three incentivized experiments. In each, we first varied whether participants were excluded or included in a virtual ball-passing game. In the second part, participants entered a two-player investment game, in which their earnings were partly dependent on the cooperativeness of their partner. We varied how cooperative the co-player was, and measured whether our participants were willing to cooperate or not. All participants entered the game twice, once with an unknown player, and once with a person who they previously encountered during the ball-passing task. Our findings were consistent with the revenge hypothesis \textendash{} excluded participants were less cooperative when they were paired with the individual who previously excluded them. Interactions with unknown players were unaffected \textendash{} excluded and included participants were equally cooperative. We propose a straightforward explanation of our findings: People do not like to cooperate with those who previously rejected them, but the experience of rejection does not have broad implications for people's overall willingness to cooperate.},

In contrast, 0\% of the 40 search terms used more frequently in states with less income inequality were classified as referring to status goods. Finally, we showed how residual-based analysis offers a new methodology for using Google Correlate to provide insights into societal attitudes and motivations while avoiding confounds and high risks of spurious correlations.},

We identified dimensions corresponding to traits of positive-habitual thoughts and spontaneous task-unrelated thoughts. These dimensions were uniquely related to aspects of cognition, such as executive control and the ability to generate information in a creative fashion, and independently distinguished well-being measures. These data provide the most convincing evidence to date for an ontological view of the mind-wandering state as encompassing a broad range of different experiences and show that this heterogeneity underlies mind wandering's complex relationship to psychological functioning.},

It is a constellation of two (Sentinel-1 A and B) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellites. The SAR wave mode (WV) routinely collects high-resolution SAR images of the ocean surface during day and night and through clouds. In this study, a subset of more than 37,000 SAR images is labelled corresponding to ten geophysical phenomena, including both oceanic and meteorologic features. These images cover the entire open ocean and are manually selected from Sentinel-1A WV acquisitions in 2016. For each image, only one prevalent geophysical phenomenon with its prescribed signature and texture is selected for labelling. The SAR images are processed into a quick-look image provided in the formats of PNG and GeoTIFF as well as the associated labels. They are convenient for both visual inspection and machine learning-based methods exploitation. The proposed dataset is the first one involving different oceanic or atmospheric phenomena over the open ocean. It seeks to foster the development of strategies or approaches for massive ocean SAR image analysis. A key objective was to allow exploiting the full potential of Sentinel-1 WV SAR acquisitions, which are about 60,000 images per satellite per month and freely available.

  abstract = {Chronic postsurgical pain (CPSP) remains a medical problem. Whether the descending modulation of nociceptive transmission from the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) plays a role in CPSP induced by skin/muscle incision and retraction (SMIR) in the thigh is still unknown. In this study, we found that SMIR surgery, which induced either bilateral or unilateral mechanical allodynia, activated microglia, and up-regulated interleukin-1{$\beta$} (IL-1{$\beta$}), an important cytokine, and 8-hydroxyguanine, an oxidative stress marker in the RVM. In addition, the release of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) was increased in the ipsilateral and contralateral RVM in rats with either bilateral or unilateral pain following SMIR. The 5-HT level increase, 5-HT3 receptor (5-HT3R) up-regulation, and microglia activation were found bilaterally in SMIR rats with bilateral pain, but only ipsilaterally in SMIR rats with unilateral pain. The intrathecal injection of the 5-HT3R antagonist Y25130 prevented the development of CPSP and the activation of spinal microglia induced by SMIR. Furthermore, P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) was up-regulated in microglia in the RVM. The microinjection of the P2X7R antagonist brilliant blue G (BBG, a non-competitive P2X7R antagonist) into the RVM prevented the development of mechanical allodynia, inhibited the activation of microglia, and decreased the expression of IL-1{$\beta$} and 8-hydroxyguanine in the RVM following SMIR. Importantly, BBG injected into the RVM also decreased the activation of microglia and the level of 5-HT in the lumbar 3 (L3) spinal cord. The microinjection of the P2X7R agonist BzATP, the NADPH oxidase activator phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate, or IL-1{$\beta$} into the RVM induced bilateral mechanical allodynia, microglia activation, and 5-HT release in the L3 spinal dorsal horn. Taken together, P2X7R activation in microglia in the RVM following SMIR might be responsible for the development of CPSP via activating descending serotonergic pathway.

We assessed the accuracy of mental health perceptions from facial appearance, and how perceived mental health related to other appearance cues, specifically attractiveness, perceived physical health, and masculinity. We constructed composite images from men scoring high and low on autistic quotient, depressive symptoms, and schizotypy inventories, and asked observers to rate these images for mental health. We found perceived mental health reflected actual mental health in all cases. Furthermore, the accuracy of mental health inference was not fully explained by other appearance cues. We consider implications of accurate mental health detection from appearance, and the possibility that appearance could be a risk factor for mental health issues.},

However, how researchers have received these proposals is not well known because, to our knowledge, no systematic investigation into use of these reforms has been conducted. We wanted to learn about the rationales researchers have for not adopting the proposed reforms. We analyzed survey data of 1,035 researchers in social and personality psychology who were asked to indicate whether they thought it was acceptable to not follow four specific proposed reforms and to explain their reasoning when they thought it was acceptable to not adopt these reforms. The four reforms were preregistering hypotheses and methods, making data publicly available online, conducting formal power analyses, and reporting effect sizes. Our results suggest that (a) researchers have adopted some of the proposed reforms (e.g., reporting effect sizes) more than others (e.g., preregistering studies) and (b) rationales for not adopting them reflect a need for more discussion and education about their utility and feasibility.},

However, it is not only physically salient stimuli that grab our attention: Recent research has shown that reward history also influences the likelihood that stimuli will capture attention. Here, we investigated whether resource-dependent control processes modulate the effect of reward on attentional capture, much as for the effect of physical salience. To this end, we used eye tracking with a rewarded visual search task and compared performance under conditions of high and low working memory load. In two experiments, we demonstrated that oculomotor capture by high-reward distractor stimuli is enhanced under high memory load. These results highlight the role of executive-control processes in modulating distraction by reward-related stimuli. Our findings have implications for understanding the neurocognitive processes involved in real-life conditions in which reward-related stimuli may influence behavior, such as addiction.},

But this bivariate correlation was only half the size of those reported in the original studies and was reduced by two thirds in the presence of controls for family background, early cognitive ability, and the home environment. Most of the variation in adolescent achievement came from being able to wait at least 20 s. Associations between delay time and measures of behavioral outcomes at age 15 were much smaller and rarely statistically significant.},

Similar observations, sometimes implicating other sections of the hippocampus, have been made for aging populations and for people with neurodegenerative diseases that affect the hippocampus. These data support the hypothesis that hippocampal volume relates to navigation ability. However, the support for this hypothesis is mixed in healthy, young adults, who range widely in their navigation ability. Here, we administered a naturalistic navigation task that measures cognitive map accuracy to a sample of 90 healthy, young adults who also had MRI scans. Using a sequential analysis design with a registered analysis plan, we did not find that navigation ability related to hippocampal volume (total, right only, right posterior only). We conclude that navigation ability in a typical population does not correlate with variations in hippocampal size, and consider possible explanations for this null result.},

Using data collected from a Mechanical Turk sample, we measured persuasiveness using ratings of video-recorded product pitches and examined the relations between psychopathic and general traits and persuasiveness across weaker (improvised) and stronger (scripted) conditions. Boldness exhibited a small, positive relation with perceived persuasiveness in the improvised condition only; conversely, psychopathic traits related to antagonism/meanness and disinhibition exhibited small negative associations with persuasiveness and trust in the scripted condition. The results suggest that boldness may help individuals persuade others so as to achieve desired outcomes, although the effect was quite small in nature, whereas psychopathic individuals who are not high on boldness may need to use other tactics (e.g., intimidation, coercion) to manipulate others.},

We extend this research by moving beyond depletion to examine a more nuanced, process-based view of self-control. We draw on integrative self-control theory (Kotabe \& Hofmann, 2015) to identify two critical moderators of the relationship between sleep and unethical behavior. Whereas prior research has focused mainly on the deleterious effects associated with depleted control capacity \textendash{} such as sleep deprivation \textendash{} we suggest that factors influencing control motivation and control effort are also an essential part of the self-regulatory process. First, we examine the role of control motivation, hypothesizing that a perceived sense of power moderates the relationship between sleep deprivation and depletion by motivating agentic, goal-directed action that mitigates the depleting effect of sleep deprivation. Second, we consider the role of control effort, hypothesizing that contemplation moderates the relationship between depletion and unethical behavior, such that depleted individuals are less likely to act unethically when contemplation is high. Three studies \textendash{} one manipulating sleep deprivation in the lab and two using natural variation in sleep quality and quantity \textendash{} suggest consistent support for our expanded model combining mediation and moderation, advancing self-regulatory research linking sleep deprivation to unethical behavior.},

By using within-person designs in a laboratory (Study 1; 187 participants) and an ambulatory assessment study (Study 2; 125 participants), we sought to clarify this ambiguity by investigating whether prominent situational variables (such as motivation and affect) or personality traits can help elucidate when ego depletion can be observed and when not. Although only marginal ego-depletion effects were found in both studies, these effects varied considerably between individuals, indicating that some individuals experience self-control decrements after initial self-control exertion and others not. However, neither motivation nor affect nor personality traits such as trait self-control could consistently explain this variability when models were applied that controlled for variance due to targets and the depletion manipulation (Study 1) or days (Study 2) as well as for multiple testing. We discuss how the operationalization and reliability of our key measures may explain these null effects and demonstrate that alternative metrics may be required to study the consequences of the consecutive exertion of self-control. \textcopyright{} 2019 European Association of Personality Psychology},

At the facet level, leadership (d = -0.20), vanity (d = -0.16), and entitlement (d = -0.28) all showed decreases.

For judgments of semantic category, the dual-task deficit was so large that it supported all-or-none serial processing: Participants could recognize only one word and had to guess about the other. Moreover, participants were more likely to be correct about one word if they were incorrect about the other, which also supports a serial-processing model.

  abstract = {Interacting with a cluttered and dynamic environment requires making decisions about visual information at relevant locations while ignoring irrelevant locations. Typical adults can do this with covert spatial attention: prioritizing particular visual field locations even without moving the eyes. Deficits of covert spatial attention have been implicated in developmental dyslexia, a specific reading disability. Previous studies of children with dyslexia, however, have been complicated by group differences in overall task ability that are difficult to distinguish from selective spatial attention. Here, we used a single-fixation visual search task to estimate orientation discrimination thresholds with and without an informative spatial cue in a large sample (N~=~123) of people ranging in age from 5 to 70 years and with a wide range of reading abilities. We assessed the efficiency of attentional selection via the cueing effect: the difference in log thresholds with and without the spatial cue. Across our whole sample, both absolute thresholds and the cueing effect gradually improved throughout childhood and adolescence. Compared to typical readers, individuals with dyslexia had higher thresholds (worse orientation discrimination) as well as smaller cueing effects (weaker attentional selection). Those differences in dyslexia were especially pronounced prior to age 20, when basic visual function is still maturing. Thus, in line with previous theories, literacy skills are associated with the development of selective spatial attention.},

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether Sol and TA MNs adapt to changes in cholinergic environment by differential regulation of their muscarinic receptors M2 (M2R). We examined Chrm2 (M2R gene) transcript level, high-affinity 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate-3H ([3H]QNB) ligand binding, distribution and density of M2R immunolabeling in lumbar (L) segments in intact and SCT rats, with or without inclusion of 5-week treadmill locomotor training. We show that at the second week after SCT the levels of Chrm2 transcript are reduced in the L3?6 segments, with [3H]QNB binding decreased selectively in the L5?6 segments, where ankle extensor MNs are predominantly located. At 5~weeks after SCT, [3H]QNB binding differences between the L3?4 and L5?6 segments are maintained, accompanied by higher density of M2R immunolabeling in the plasma membrane and cytoplasm of TA than Sol MNs and by enriched synaptic versus extrasynaptic M2R pools (52\% TA vs. 25\% Sol MNs). Training normalized M2R in TA MNs, improved locomotion, and reduced frequency of clonic episodes. Our findings indicate higher sensitivity of TA than Sol MNs to cholinergic signaling after SCT, which might shorten flexor twitches duration and contribute to generation of clonic movements. Synaptic enrichment in M2R density may reflect a compensatory mechanism activated in TA and Sol MNs to different extent in response to reduced strength of cholinergic signaling to each MN pool.

Six groups of listeners performed a speeded ABX discrimination task in Japanese. Groups were defined by their L1, L2, and L3 experience with the target language's pitch cues (Japanese), a language with less informative pitch cues (English), or a language with more informative pitch cues (Mandarin Chinese). Results indicate that sensitivity to pitch is better modeled as a function of pitch's informativeness across all languages a listener speaks. These findings support cue-centric views of perception and transfer, demonstrate potential advantageous transfer of tonal-L1/L2 speakers, and highlight the cumulative role that pitch plays in language learning.},

Mixed-effects modeling revealed that upon hearing truncated speech, L2 learners, like native speakers, identified high token frequency syllable\textendash tone combinations more accurately than low token frequency syllable\textendash tone combinations. Error analysis of correct syllable/incorrect tone responses revealed that native speakers made specific probability-based errors. L2 learners primarily demonstrated more acoustic-based errors but exhibited a trend toward greater probability-based errors during the second test.

This study examined to which extent the neural processes involved in recognising personally familiar faces depend on attentional resources by analysing event-related brain potentials. In two experiments, participants were presented with multiple ambient images of highly personally familiar and unfamiliar faces and pictures of butterflies, with a letter string superimposed on each image. Their task was either to indicate when a butterfly occurred (effectively ignoring the letter strings) or to indicate whether each letter string contained the letter X or N. Attentional resource load was manipulated in the letter task by presenting the target among different distractor letters (high load; Experiment 1) or by using only a single repeated letter in each string (low load; Experiment 2). ERPs revealed more negative amplitudes for familiar relative to unfamiliar faces under both high and low load conditions, both in the N250, reflecting the activation of perceptual face representations, and in the subsequent Sustained Familiarity Effect (SFE). Nonetheless, while the magnitude of the N250 effect was not substantially affected by attentional load, the SFE was still present but reduced in the high relative to the low load experiment. These findings suggest that perceptual face representations are activated independent of the demands of a competing task. However, the subsequent SFE, presumably reflecting more sustained activation needed to access identity-specific knowledge that can guide potential interactions, strongly relies on the availability of attentional resources.},

However, work making this comparison has reported no difference between these two types of priming. Importantly, the reported non-differences have been found in the visual domain. Here, we investigate morphological (Morph) versus~repetition (Rep) priming in two auditory primed lexical decision experiments. Using the English plural suffix -/z/, we compare Rep priming with Morph priming for both singular and plural target conditions (e.g., frog/frogs~\textrightarrow ~frog, frog/frogs~\textrightarrow ~frogs). Overall, we find robust priming in both Rep and Morph conditions. However, for both singular and plural targets, there is consistent evidence that Rep priming is greater than Morph priming at early lags of 0 and 1 intervening items. This facilitation decreases with an increasing number of intervening items. Comparisons with phonological and semantic controls demonstrate that this pattern cannot be attributed solely to shared form or meaning. We interpret these findings in a decompositional model of morphological processing. The robust facilitation in Morph and Rep conditions is attributed to the activation of a shared stem representation. The convergence of Morph and Rep is attributed to a diminishing episodic trace related to morphological recombination.},

  abstract = {Virtually any inferential statistical analysis relies on distributional assumptions of some kind. The violation of distributional assumptions can result in consequences ranging from small changes to error rates through to substantially biased estimates and parameters fundamentally losing their intended interpretations. Conventionally, researchers have conducted assumption checks after collecting data, and then changed the primary analysis technique if violations of distributional assumptions are observed. An approach to dealing with distributional assumptions that requires decisions to be made contingent on observed data is problematic, however, in preregisteredresearch, where researchers attempt to specify all important analysis decisions prior to collecting data. Limited methodological advice is currently available regarding how to deal with the prospect of distributional assumption violations in preregistered research. In this article, we examine several strategies that researchers could use in preregistrations to reduce the potential impact of distributional assumption violations. We suggest that pre-emptively selecting analysis methods that are as robust as possible to assumption violations, performing planned robustness analyses, and/or supplementing preregistered confirmatory analyses with exploratory checks of distributional assumptions may all be useful strategies. On the other hand, we suggest that prespecifying ``decision trees'' for selecting data analysis methods based on the distributional characteristics of the data may not be practical in most situations.},

Moreover, in Study 2, we found that the link between trustworthiness and the death sentence occurred even when participants viewed innocent people who had been exonerated after originally being sentenced to death.

In the present study, we used cultured astrocytes \textendash{} the cell type which shows prominent swelling in stroke \textendash{} to model how metabolic stress and changes in gene expression may impact VRAC function in the ischemic and post-ischemic brain. The metabolic state of primary rat astrocytes was modified with chemical inhibitors and examined using luciferin\textendash luciferase ATP assays and a Seahorse analyzer. Swelling-activated glutamate release was quantified with the radiotracer D-[3H]aspartate. The specific contribution of VRAC to swelling-activated glutamate efflux was validated by RNAi knockdown of the essential subunit, leucine-rich repeat-containing 8A (LRRC8A); expression levels of VRAC components were measured with qRT-PCR. Using this methodology, we found that complete metabolic inhibition with the glycolysis blocker 2-deoxy-D-glucose and the mitochondrial poison sodium cyanide reduced astrocytic ATP levels by {$>$} 90\% and abolished glutamate release from swollen cells (via VRAC). When only mitochondrial respiration was inhibited by cyanide or rotenone, the intracellular ATP levels and VRAC activity were largely preserved. Bypassing glycolysis by providing the mitochondrial substrates pyruvate and/or glutamine led to partial recovery of ATP levels and VRAC activity. Unexpectedly, the metabolic block of VRAC was overridden when ATP-depleted cells were exposed to extreme cell swelling ({$\geq$} 50\% reduction in medium osmolarity). Twenty-four hour anoxic adaptation caused a moderate reduction in the expression levels of the VRAC component LRRC8A, but no significant changes in VRAC activity. Overall, our findings suggest that (i) astrocytic VRAC activity and metabolism can be sustained by low levels of glucose and (ii) the inhibitory influence of diminishing ATP levels and the stimulatory effect of cellular swelling are the two major factors that govern VRAC activity in the ischemic brain.},

  abstract = {Efforts to increase replication rates in psychology generally consist of recommended improvements to methodology, such as increasing sample sizes to increase power or using a lower alpha level. However, little attention has been paid to how the prior odds (R) that a tested effect is true can affect the probability that a significant result will be replicable. The lower R is, the less likely a published result will be replicable even if power is high. It follows that if R is lower in one set of studies than in another, then all else being equal, published results will be less replicable in the set with lower R. We illustrate this point by presenting an analysis of data from the social-psychology and cognitive-psychology studies that were included in the Open Science Collaboration's (2015) replication project. We found that R was lower for the social-psychology studies than for the cognitive-psychology studies, which might explain why the rate of successful replications differed between these two sets of studies. This difference in replication rates may reflect the degree to which scientists in the two fields value risky but potentially groundbreaking (i.e., low-R) research. Critically, high-R research is not inherently better or worse than low-R research for advancing knowledge. However, if they wish to achieve replication rates comparable to those of high-R fields (a judgment call), researchers in low-R fields would need to use an especially low alpha level, conduct experiments that have especially high power, or both.},

But what enables people to be interpersonally responsive to others? In the current study, we argued that responsiveness requires not only accurate understanding but also compassionate motivation. Specifically, we hypothesized that understanding another person's thoughts and feelings (empathic accuracy) would foster responsive behavior only when paired with benevolent motivation (empathic concern). To test this idea, we asked couples (N = 91) to discuss a personal or relationship stressor; we then assessed empathic accuracy, empathic concern, and responsive behavior. As predicted, when listeners' empathic concern was high, empathic accuracy facilitated responsiveness; but when empathic concern was low, empathic accuracy was unhelpful (and possibly harmful) for responsiveness. These findings provide the first evidence that cognitive and affective forms of empathy work together to facilitate responsive behavior.},

However, researchers have not yet systematically investigated why individuals ostracize others. One impediment to this research is lacking multiple means to successfully induce individuals to be sources, those who ostracize others. Using Cyberball, researchers found participants ostracized a player delaying the game. To aid in systematic research on sources, we developed the game Atimia. In Atimia, players took turns solving remote associate word items and we varied the performance of a computer-controlled player to perform equal to or significantly worse than the group. Without prompting, participants ostracized a poor- versus equal-performing player more and found the poor-performing player burdensome, less likable, and less desirable to work with on a future task. Study outcomes suggest Atimia is a viable paradigm for investigating sources of ostracism.},

We raise questions about this approach by demonstrating that head movements can dramatically shift the appearance of the face to shape social judgments without engaging facial musculature. In five studies (total N = 1,517), we found that when eye gaze was directed forward, tilting one's head downward (compared with a neutral angle) increased perceptions of dominance, and this effect was due to the illusory appearance of lowered and V-shaped eyebrows caused by a downward head tilt. Tilting one's head downward therefore functions as an action-unit imposter, creating the artificial appearance of a facial action unit that has a strong effect on social perception. Social judgments about faces are therefore driven not only by facial shape and musculature but also by movements in the face's physical foundation: the head.},

  abstract = {What is best criterion for determining statistical significance? In psychology, the criterion has been p {$<$} .05. This criterion has been criticized since its inception, and the criticisms have been rejuvenated with recent failures to replicate studies published in top psychology journals. Several replacement criteria have been suggested including reducing the alpha level to .005 or switching to other types of criteria such as Bayes factors or effect sizes. Here, various decision criteria for statistical significance were evaluated using signal detection analysis on the outcomes of simulated data. The signal detection measure of area under the curve (AUC) is a measure of discriminability with a value of 1 indicating perfect discriminability and 0.5 indicating chance performance. Applied to criteria for statistical significance, it provides an estimate of the decision criterion's performance in discriminating real effects from null effects. AUCs were high (M = .96, median = .97) for p values, suggesting merit in using p values to discriminate significant effects. AUCs can be used to assess methodological questions such as how much improvement will be gained with increased sample size, how much discriminability will be lost with questionable research practices, and whether it is better to run a single high-powered study or a study plus a replication at lower powers. AUCs were also used to compare performance across p values, Bayes factors, and effect size (Cohen's d). AUCs were equivalent for p values and Bayes factors and were slightly higher for effect size. Signal detection analysis provides separate measures of discriminability and bias. With respect to bias, the specific thresholds that produced maximally-optimal utility depended on sample size, although this dependency was particularly notable for p values and less so for Bayes factors. The application of signal detection theory to the issue of statistical significance highlights the need to focus on both false alarms and misses, rather than false alarms alone.},

According to the action-specific account, perception of spatial layout is influenced by the perceiver's abilities to perform an intended action. Alternative accounts posit that purported effects are instead due to nonperceptual processes, such as response bias. Despite much confirmatory research on both sides of the debate, researchers who promote a response-bias account have never used the Pong task, which has yielded one of the most robust action-specific effects. Conversely, researchers who promote a perceptual account have rarely used the opposition's preferred test for response bias, namely, the postexperiment survey. The current experiments rectified this. We found that even for people naive to the experiment's hypothesis, the ability to block a moving ball affected the ball's perceived speed. Moreover, when participants were explicitly told the hypothesis and instructed to resist the influence of their ability to block the ball, their ability still affected their perception of the ball's speed.},

A clear N2 posterior-contralateral (N2pc) component (a neural marker of attention shifts) was found in both the masked and unmasked conditions, revealing that one's own face automatically captures attention when processed unconsciously. Therefore, our study (a) demonstrates that self-related information is boosted at an early (preconscious) stage of processing, (b) identifies further features (beyond simple physical ones) that cause automatic attention capture, and (c) provides further evidence for the dissociative nature of attention and consciousness.},

In a cross-sectional study, 124 PD patients underwent extensive clinical and neuropsychological assessment as well as a 3T MRI scan of the brain. Our aim was to identify differences in grey matter volume and thickness, as well as cortical folding, across different cognitive profiles as defined through a data-driven exploratory cluster analysis of neuropsychological data. The identified cognitive groups ranged from cognitively intact patients to patients with severe deficits in all cognitive domains, whilst showing comparable levels of motor disability and disease duration. Each group was compared to the cognitively intact PD group using voxel- and vertex-based morphometry. Results revealed widespread age-related grey matter abnormalities associated with progressive worsening of cognitive functions in mild PD. When adjusted for age, significant differences were only seen between cognitively intact and severely affected PD patients and these were restricted to the right posterior cingulate and the right precuneus. Reduced cortical thickness was seen in the right inferior temporal gyrus and reduced folding in the right temporal region. As these differences were not associated with age, we assume that they are associated with underlying pathology of the cognitive decline. Given the limited involvement of grey matter differences, and the absence of differences in vascular changes across the groups, we hypothesize a more important role for white matter tract changes in cognitive decline in PD.},

Demonization and desecration are negative spiritual appraisals associated with psychological maladjustment across political and relational contexts. Sanctification refers to the imbuing of persons, objects, or events with sacred qualities or as manifestations of a higher power. The authors examined the prevalence and role of spiritual appraisals related to the 2016 U.S. presidential election result on psychological adjustment and behaviors using a cross-sectional online sample of 252 American voters. Approximately one-fifth of participants sanctified the election of President Trump to some degree. Conversely, approximately one-third of participants endorsed some level of negative spiritual appraisals. Desecration and demonization also uniquely predicted maladjustment. Moreover, the interactive effect between vote and negative spiritual appraisals accounted for unique variance in maladjustment. At higher levels of demonization and desecration, those who voted for President Trump reported greater difficulties with emotion regulation than those who voted against President Trump. Negative spiritual appraisals also moderated the relations between vote and thought suppression, in addition to vote and information seeking behavior. For the small fraction of Trump voters with negative spiritual appraisals, their efforts to suppress misgivings, struggle with emotions, and seek information may be understood as attempts to reduce cognitive dissonance.},

With precise measurements of each chick's behavior, we were able to perform individual-level analyses and substantially reduce measurement error for the group-level analyses. We found no evidence that newborn chicks encode the TPs between sequentially presented shapes. None of the chicks showed evidence for this ability. Conversely, we obtained strong evidence that newborn chicks encode the shapes of individual objects, showing that this automated method can produce robust results.

Results indicated that participants expected attractive individuals to use direct opening gambits (M = 10.84, SD = 3.33) more often than less attractive individuals (M = 5.87, SD = 2.87), F(1,114) = 72.97, p {$<$} .001, {$\eta$}p2 = .39.

They demonstrated that after being told to associate three identities (self, friend, stranger) with three arbitrary stimuli (geometrical shapes), participants were faster in a perceptual matching task to recognise matching pairs of self-associated shape with self-label, than respective friend or stranger-related pairings. They interpreted this as evidence that a brief self-association is sufficient to facilitate processing of previously neutral stimuli. However, in the matching trials of the self-prioritization task, participants are processing not only self-associated arbitrary stimuli but also familiar verbal labels with an established meaning. Therefore, the self-advantage may be caused by familiarity of the labels, rather than self-association of the shapes. To test whether self-prioritization can be elicited in a task employing exclusively neutral stimuli, we asked participants to associate avatar faces with three identities (self, name of best friend, and stranger) and replaced labels with unfamiliar abstract symbols that were associated to the words (you, friend, stranger) before the actual experiment started. The results presented the usual pattern of self-prioritization showing that this effect does not critically depend on the presence of familiar labels and that it can be elicited in the absence of any familiar stimuli.},

This claim is tested using a novel data set of policy change in the European Union (EU), covering 211 policy issues and 6,506 observations of opinion\textendash policy dyads. Results show that measures weighting opinion across member states by how much national citizens care about an issue are better predictors of policy change than EU-wide mean opinion. Moreover, congruence between state-level opinion and EU-level policy becomes more likely, the more salient and clear-cut opinion in a member state is.

  abstract = {Trait domains of the five-factor model are not orthogonal, and two metatraits have often been estimated from their covariation. Here, we focus on the stability metatrait, which reflects shared variance in conscientiousness, agreeableness, and (inversely) neuroticism. It has been hypothesized that stability manifests, in part, because of individual differences in central serotonergic functioning. We explored this possibility in a community sample (N = 441) using a multiverse analysis of (a) multi-informant five-factor-model traits and (b) stability as a predictor of individual differences in central serotonergic functioning. Differences in serotonergic functioning were assessed by indexing change in serum prolactin concentration following intravenous infusion of citalopram, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Results were mixed, showing that trait neuroticism, agreeableness, and conscientiousness, as well as the stability metatrait, were significantly associated with prolactin response but that these findings were contingent on a number of modeling decisions. Specifically, these effects were nonlinear, emerging most strongly for participants with the highest levels (or lowest, for neuroticism) of the component traits.},

Does multiple object individuation operate only over bounded, separable objects or does it operate equally over connected features within a single object? While previous fMRI experiments suggest that connectedness affects the processing and enumeration of objects, recent behavioral and EEG studies demonstrated that parallel individuation occurs over both object parts and distinct objects. However, it is unclear whether individuation of object parts and distinct objects relies on a common or independent neural mechanisms. Using fMRI-based multivariate pattern analyses, we here demonstrate that activity patterns in inferior and superior intraparietal sulci (IPS) encode numerosity independently of whether the individuated items are connected parts of a single object or distinct objects. Lateral occipital cortex is more sensitive to perceptual aspects of the two stimulus types and the targets of the stimuli, suggesting a dissociation between ventral and dorsal areas in representing perceptual object properties and more general information about numerosity, respectively. Our results suggest that objecthood is not a necessary prerequisite for parallel individuation in IPS. Rather, our results point toward a common individuation mechanism that selects targets over a flexible object hierarchy, independently of whether the targets are distinct separable objects or parts of a single object.},

  abstract = {Eye tracking is widely used in developmental research to measure infants' looking behavior before, during, or after particular events and can provide a measure of real-time processing. However, the dynamic time course of infants' looking behaviors is rarely analyzed. Instead, eye tracking data is often averaged within a large window or is restricted to certain predictive or reactive looks before or after an event, which could conceal interesting looking patterns. In this article, we discuss an alternative approach using spline models \textendash{} an approachable and informative method for analyzing how the trajectory of infants' looking behaviors changes at discrete time points. We illustrate the benefits of spline models by demonstrating how to prepare, estimate, and interpret the results of a spline model in R and SAS, and we compare the results with an analysis of averaged looking times within a time window. We show that spline models can reveal patterns in the trajectory of participants' looking that can be obscured by averaged looking times. Finally, we use a sensitivity analysis to show that spline models are reliable with small samples typical of developmental studies. Spline models can be useful to developmental researchers for analyzing the time course of event-based changes in eye tracking data.},

Across six studies, we showed that these tendencies are robust, large in magnitude, tuned to intentional rather than unintentional noncontribution, and generally consistent across third- and first-party cases. Further, these effects cannot be accounted for by factors that frequently co-occur with free riding, such as nonconforming behaviors or the costs that free riding imposes on the group.

Prior research has generally explained such preference mismatches as decision makers mispredicting recipients' satisfaction. We proposed that a ``smile-seeking'' motive is a distinct cause for these mismatches in the context of gift giving. After examining common gift options for which gift givers expect a difference between the recipients' affective reaction (e.g., a smile when receiving the gift) and overall satisfaction, we found that givers often chose to forgo satisfaction-maximizing gifts and instead favor reaction-maximizing gifts. This reaction-maximizing preference was mitigated when givers anticipated not giving the gift in person. Results from six studies suggest that anticipated affective reactions powerfully shape gift givers' choices and giving experiences, independently of (and even in spite of) anticipated recipient satisfaction. These findings reveal a dominant yet overlooked role that the display of affective reactions plays in motivating and rewarding gift-giving behaviors and shed new light on interpersonal decision making.},

Subjects consistently spotted the change if it occurred while the array moved along a straight path but missed it when it occurred as the array changed direction.

Under crowding, observers misreported colors and orientations (i.e., reported a flanker value instead of the target's value) but averaged the target's and flankers' spatial frequencies (SFs). Interestingly, whereas orientation and color errors were independent, orientation and SF errors were interdependent. These qualitative differences of errors across dimensions revealed a tight link between crowding and feature binding, which is contingent on the type of feature dimension. These results and a computational model suggest that crowding and misbinding are due to pooling across a joint coding of orientations and SFs but not of colors.},

Threat appraisals (Days 5\textendash 9 after intervention) and neuroendocrine responses (Days 8 and 9 after intervention only) were unrelated to the intensity of daily stressors when adolescents received the incremental-theory intervention. Students who received the intervention also had better grades over freshman year than those who did not. These findings offer new avenues for improving theories of adolescent stress and coping.},

  abstract = {Abstract Despite the importance of somatodendritic dopamine (DA) release in the Substantia Nigra pars compacta (SNc), its mechanism remains poorly understood. Using a novel approach combining fast-scan controlled-adsorption voltammetry (FSCAV) and single-unit electrophysiology, we have investigated the mechanism of somatodendritic release by directly correlating basal (non-stimulated) extracellular DA concentration ([DA]out), with pharmacologically-induced changes of firing of nigral dopaminergic neurons in rat brain slices. FSCAV measurements indicated that basal [DA]out in the SNc was 40.7~{$\pm~$}2.0~nM (at 34~{$\pm~$}0.5\textdegree C), which was enhanced by amphetamine, cocaine, and L-DOPA, and reduced by VMAT2 inhibitor, Ro4-1284. Complete inhibition of firing by TTX decreased basal [DA]out, but this reduction was smaller than the effect of D2 receptor agonist, quinpirole. Despite similar effects on neuronal firing, the larger decrease in [DA]out evoked by quinpirole was attributed to cell membrane hyperpolarization and greater reduction in cytosolic free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]in). Decreasing extracellular Ca2+ also reduced basal [DA]out, despite increasing firing frequency. Furthermore, inhibiting L-type Ca2+ channels decreased basal [DA]out, although specific Cav1.3 channel inhibition did not affect firing rate. Inhibition of sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) also decreased [DA]out, demonstrating the importance of intracellular Ca2+ stores for somatodendritic release. Finally, in~vivo FSCAV measurements showed that basal [DA]out in the SNc was 79.8~{$\pm~$}10.9~nM in urethane-anesthetized rats, which was enhanced by amphetamine. Overall, our findings indicate that although tonic somatodendritic DA release is largely independent of action potentials, basal [DA]out is strongly regulated by voltage-dependent Ca2+ influx and release of intracellular Ca2+.

In addition, little is known about whether cognitive aptitudes can moderate such sensitivity. This study examined L1 and advanced L2 speakers' statistical sensitivity to phrasal frequency and contingency as well as cognitive aptitudes' moderating effects on such sensitivity when processing English adjective-noun collocations. Participants performed a phrasal acceptability judgment task (PJT). Meanwhile, their aptitude profiles were measured by six aptitude tests, which loaded separately onto implicit language aptitude, explicit language aptitude, and working memory capacity. Linear mixed-effects modeling revealed that both L1 and L2 English speakers were sensitive to phrasal frequency and contingency of collocations, although L2 speakers' sensitivity was much stronger than that of L1 speakers. None of the aptitudes was found to moderate language users' statistical sensitivity to either collocation frequency or contingency. Interestingly, disassociation patterns between the PJT performance and the involvement of implicit or explicit language aptitude among the L1 and L2 speakers were found. It was concluded that L1 and L2 speakers differed in terms of the way they processed the collocations, as well as the nature of their collocational knowledge.},

In a series of experiments, we found that 14-month-olds could rapidly learn a label for the role played by the chaser in a chasing scenario, even when the different instances of chasers did not share perceptual features. Furthermore, when infants could choose, they preferred to interpret a novel label as expressing the agent's role within the observed interaction rather than as being associated with the agent's appearance. These results demonstrate that infants can learn labels as easily (or even more easily) for concepts identified by abstract behavioral characteristics as for objects identified by perceptual features.

This hypothesis was examined using displays with and without handshaking interactions. Results demonstrated that object-based attention, which was measured by an object-specific attentional advantage (i.e., shorter response times to targets on a single object), was extended to two hands performing a handshake but not to hands that did not perform meaningful social interactions, even when they did perform handshake-like actions. This finding cannot be attributed to the familiarity of the frequent co-occurrence of two handshaking hands. Hence, object-based attention can select a grouped object whose parts are connected within a meaningful social interaction.

  abstract = {Facial attractiveness (FA) is a highly agreed upon and socially important characteristic, but contemporary research has not fully investigated individuals' enhancement of their FA. We used the social relations model (SRM) to analyze data from 187 participants. In face-to-face groups of four, participants rated their own and others' FA. We assessed the degree of FA enhancement using unconfounded measures of both self-insight and social comparison. Results indicated African Americans and men enhanced more than Caucasians and women. Race effects were mediated by psychological adjustment, while gender effects were related to meta-perceptions. Men tended to view themselves through a ``frog prince'' lens, such that they accurately predicted others' lesser views of them but persisted in overly positive self-perceptions of FA. Findings suggest further consideration of SRM measures, meta-perceptions, and a focus on sample diversity in the study of self-enhancement.},

However, perceiving AVs as having a human-like mind reduced this difference. Study 2 extended this finding by manipulating AV mindedness. Describing AVs' decision-making capacity in mentalistic terms (relative to mechanistic terms) reduced blame and anger and fostered greater trust and perceptions of morality. Study 3, replicated these findings, and demonstrated that perceived mindedness predicted judgments of trust, morality, and willingness to purchase or ride in an AV. These findings suggest that people's moral reservations about AVs may derive from doubting that AVs have the mental capacities necessary for moral judgment, and that one route for improving trust in AVs is to design them with a veneer of human-like mental qualities.},

We then externally validated models in a community clinic (N = 511) with the same candidate predictors and semistructured interview diagnoses, providing high methodological consistency; the clinics also had substantially different demography and referral patterns. Models performed well according to internal validation metrics. Complex models degraded rapidly when externally validated. Naive Bayesian and logistic models concentrating on predictors identified in prior meta-analyses tied or bettered LASSO models when externally validated. Implementing these methods would improve clinical diagnostic performance.

We show that when we controlled for additive area, observers were unable to discriminate on the basis of true area, per se, and that these results could not be explained by other spatial dimensions. These findings reflect a powerful perceptual illusion in their own right but also have implications for other work, namely, that which relies on area controls to support claims about number estimation.

Datasets from 35 healthy participants were analyzed. Behaviorally, in line with previous research, participants displayed sensitivity to outcome devaluation, a hallmark of goal-directed control. Electrophysiologically, decreased N2 and increased error-related negativity (ERN) amplitudes were associated with slips of action in conditions that could potentially engage both the goal-directed and habitual systems. These amplitude differences were more pronounced in participants that displayed more sensitivity to devaluation. Furthermore, we show how specific neurophysiological learning signals, namely ERN and feedback-locked P3, could predict subsequent sensitivity to devaluation. Our findings indicate that the N2 and ERN components can be used as indices of goal-directed versus habitual control, and emphasize the importance of the ERN as an electrophysiological trait in the context of goal-directed behavior.},

  abstract = {Insect nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are not only important neurotransmitter receptors but also effective insecticide targets. The regulation of nAChRs has been mainly studied in vertebrates, especially in mammals. Here, two types of nAChRs were found present in the locust Locusta migratoria manilensis dorsal unpaired median (DUM) neurons, {$\alpha$}-bungarotoxin ({$\alpha$}-Bgt)-sensitive nAChRs and {$\alpha$}-Bgt-resistant nAChRs, responding to acetylcholine (ACh) at different concentrations. The homologs to three mammalian nAChR regulators, ubiquilin-1, CRELD2 (cysteine-rich with EFG-like domain 2), and PICK1 (protein interacting with PRKCA 1), were characterized in L. migratoria, and their functions on regulating native nAChRs were investigated via RNAi followed by membrane potential measurement with DiBAC4(3) and agonist-evoked macroscopic current recording in cultured L. migratoria DUM neurons. Ubiquilin-1 and PICK1 negatively regulated nAChRs because silencing of ubiquilin-1 and PICK1 both resulted in increased membrane potential and increased inward currents in DUM neurons, while CRELD2 positively regulated nAChRs as decreased membrane potential and inward currents were observed in DUM neurons. In addition, ubiquilin-1 regulated both {$\alpha$}-Bgt-sensitive and {$\alpha$}-Bgt-resistant types of nAChRs whereas PICK1 and CRELD2 regulated only the {$\alpha$}-Bgt-resistant nAChRs. The present study broadened our understanding on the regulation of insect nAChRs and will benefit pest management given the important role of nAChRs in insect neurons and insecticide science.

In the first phase of the experiment, using the associative terms task, we detected nine of the most frequent terms that were associated with the concept of ``privacy'' in each culture. In the second phase, using the judged-similarity task, we asked participants to rate the degree to which each of the nine terms from the previous phase was associated with every other term and with the concept of ``privacy.'' Results from a correspondence analysis model suggest similarities in the mapping of terms related to ``privacy'' along the dichotomous dimension of physical vs. informational concerns. However, cultural differences emerged in a second dimension, the extent to which individualism vs. collectivism was stressed. While ``personal privacy'' and an individual's relationship with the government was important for American adults, the main focus for Iranian adults was ``familial privacy'' and family-centered living.},

We ran two experiments where participants were required to respond as fast as possible to a median nerve stimulation (go-signal), while sub-M1-threshold single pulse TMS was delivered either on left (contralateral) PMv or right (ipsilateral to sensory stimulus and motor response) PMv, 5\textendash 65~ms after the go-signal. TMS delivered on either PMv up to 25~ms after the go-signal shortened reaction time. This is the time window compatible with the arrive of sensory afferences, as if conditioning before sensory afferences arrive lower the threshold needed to release the pre-planned motor program to the primary motor cortex. This is in line with a putative PMv function of buffer of pre-planned motor program not strictly lateralized in one hemisphere.},

Experiment 3 demonstrated that, irrespective of how a policy was framed, people were most supportive of a policy championed by a leader high in moral character.

  abstract = {Long time horizons and social distance are viewed as key psychological barriers to proenvironmental action, particularly regarding climate change. We suggest that these challenges can be turned into opportunities by making salient long-term goals and motives, thus shifting preferences between the present self and future others. We tested whether individuals' motivation to leave a positive legacy can be leveraged to increase engagement with climate change and other environmental problems. In a pilot study, we found that individual differences in legacy motivation were positively associated with proenvironmental behaviors and intentions. In a subsequent experiment, we demonstrated that priming legacy motives increased donations to an environmental charity, proenvironmental intentions, and climate-change beliefs. Domain-general legacy motives represent a previously understudied and powerful mechanism for promoting proenvironmental behavior.},

In two studies, we examined the relation between learning rate and subsequent retention using a new foreign-language paired-associates task (the learningefficiency task), which was designed to eliminate ceiling effects that often accompany standardized tests of learning and memory in healthy adults. A key finding was that quicker learners were also more durable learners (i.e., exhibited better retention across a delay), despite studying the material for less time. Additionally, measures of learning and memory from this task were reliable in Study 1 (N = 281) across 30 hr and Study 2 (N = 92; follow-up n = 46) across 3 years. We conclude that people vary in how efficiently they learn, and we describe a reliable and valid method for assessing learning efficiency within healthy adults.},

Two studies have tested a parasite stress explanation of general trust using cross-cultural data, showing a linear negative correlation between parasite stress and trust in ``most people.'' However, recent studies suggest that 1) trust in most people as a measure of general trust confounds ingroup trust and outgroup trust in cross-cultural surveys and 2) parasite stress can curvilinearly correlate with variables of ingroup embeddedness and outgroup avoidance. Using data from the World Value Survey (WVS) Waves 5 and 6 (N = 117,370 from 80 countries and geopolitical regions), we found no evidence that parasite stress\textemdash measured either as contemporary non-sexually-transmitted-disease (non-STD) stress or as historical pathogen prevalence\textemdash curvilinearly correlated with ingroup trust. However, parasite stress significantly curvilinearly correlated with outgroup trust, and the two-line test confirmed that the correlation was U-shaped. This research extends previous work on parasite stress and trust, informs the recent debate on whether parasite stress relates to outgroup avoidance, and suggests directions for developing the parasite stress theory of values and sociality.},

  abstract = {Abstract HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder affects about half of HIV-infected patients. HIV impairs neuronal function through indirect mechanisms mainly mediated by inflammatory cytokines and neurotoxic viral proteins, such as the envelope protein gp120. HIV gp120 elicits a neuroinflammatory response that potentiates NMDA receptor function and induces the loss of excitatory synapses. How gp120 influences neuronal inhibition remains unknown. In this study, we expressed a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged recombinant antibody-like protein that binds to the post-synaptic scaffolding protein gephyrin to label inhibitory synapses in living neurons. Treatment with 600 pM gp120 for 24~h increased the number of labeled inhibitory synapses. HIV gp120 evoked the release of interleukin-1? (IL-1?) from microglia to activate IL-1 receptors on neurons. Subsequent activation of the tyrosine kinase Src and GluN2A-containing NMDA receptors increased the number of inhibitory synapses via a process that required protein synthesis. In na\"ive cultures, inhibition of neuronal p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) increased the number of inhibitory synapses suggesting that p38 MAPK produces a basal suppression of inhibitory synapses that is overcome in the presence of gp120. Direct activation of a mutant form of p38 MAPK expressed in neurons mimicked basal suppression of inhibitory synapses. This study shows for the first time that gp120-induced neuroinflammation increases the number of inhibitory synapses and that this increase overcomes a basal suppression of synaptic inhibition. Increased inhibition may be an adaptive mechanism enabling neurons to counteract excess excitatory input in order to maintain network homeostasis.

  abstract = {Although documenting everyday activities may seem trivial, four studies reveal                     that creating records of the present generates unexpected benefits by allowing                     future rediscoveries. In Study 1, we used a time-capsule paradigm to show that                     individuals underestimate the extent to which rediscovering experiences from the                     past will be curiosity provoking and interesting in the future. In Studies 2 and                     3, we found that people are particularly likely to underestimate the pleasure of                     rediscovering ordinary, mundane experiences, as opposed to extraordinary                     experiences. Finally, Study 4 demonstrates that underestimating the pleasure of                     rediscovery leads to time-inconsistent choices: Individuals forgo opportunities                     to document the present but then prefer rediscovering those moments in the                     future to engaging in an alternative fun activity. Underestimating the value of                     rediscovery is linked to people's erroneous faith in their memory of everyday                     events. By documenting the present, people provide themselves with the                     opportunity to rediscover mundane moments that may otherwise have been                     forgotten.},

  abstract = {Herpes simplex virus-type 1 (HSV-1) infection of sensory neurons may lead to a significant reduction in the expression of voltage-activated Na+ and Ca2+ channels, which can disrupt the transmission of pain information. Viral infection also results in the secretion of various pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-6. In this work, we tested whether IL-6 regulates the expression of Na+ and Ca2+ channels post-HSV-1 infection in ND7/23 sensory-like neurons. Our results demonstrate that HSV-1 infection causes a significant decrease in the protein expression of the Cav3.2 T-type Ca2+ channel subunit, despite increasing Cav3.2 mRNA synthesis. Neither Cav3.2 mRNA nor total protein content was affected by IL-6 treatment post-HSV-1 infection. In ND7/23 cells, HSV-1 infection caused a significant reduction in the expression of Na+ and T-type Ca2+ channels within 48 h. Exposure of ND7/23 cells to IL-6 for 24 h post-infection reverses the effect of HSV-1, resulting in a significant increase in T-type Ca2+ current density. However, Na+ currents were not restored by 24-h treatment with IL-6 post-HSV-1 infection of ND7/23 cells. The ability of IL-6 to increase the functional expression of T-type Ca2+ channels on the membrane was blocked by the inhibition of protein trafficking with brefeldin-A and ERK1/2 activation. These results indicate that IL-6 release following HSV-1 infection regulates the expression of T-type Ca2+ channels, which may alter the transmission of pain information.},

  abstract = {This research examines how people perceive and respond to potential conflict in work settings. When individuals highly value their interpersonal relationships with others, they may take the potential costs to relationships into consideration in deciding how to handle conflict. We propose that individuals take an avoidance approach to conflict to prevent disruption in relationships from confrontation. Specifically, the value that individuals place on superficial harmony is positively related to their negative anticipation of relationship costs, which in turn leads to conflict avoidance. Furthermore, the direct relationship between superficial harmony and negative anticipation and the indirect relationship between superficial harmony and conflict avoidance are negatively moderated by the closeness of relations between the parties involved. The results of two studies conducted in workplace settings supported our hypothesized moderated mediation model. Highlighting the role of superficial harmony in conflict avoidance, this research contributes to the existing literature on conflict management and has practical implications for effectively managing conflict in the workplace.

Sum\'ario:
Esta pesquisa examina como as pessoas percebem e respondem a conflitos potenciais em ambientes de trabalho. Quando os indiv\'iduos valorizam suas rela\c{c}\~oes interpessoais com outros, eles podem levar em considera\c{c}\~ao os custos potenciais aos relacionamentos ao decidir como lidar com conflitos. N\'os propomos que indiv\'iduos adotam uma abordagem de evitar o conflito para impedir a ruptura em relacionamentos devido ao confronto. Especificamente, o valor que os indiv\'iduos dedicam \`a harmonia superficial est\'a positivamente relacionado com sua antecipa\c{c}\~ao negativa de custos de relacionamento, o que, por sua vez, leva a evitar conflitos. Al\'em disso, a rela\c{c}\~ao direta entre harmonia superficial e antecipa\c{c}\~ao negativa e a rela\c{c}\~ao indireta entre harmonia superficial e evas\~ao de conflitos s\~ao negativamente moderadas pela proximidade das rela\c{c}\~oes entre as partes envolvidas. Os resultados de dois estudos realizados em ambientes de trabalho apoiaram o modelo de media\c{c}\~ao moderada hipotetizado. Ao destacar o papel da harmonia superficial na evas\~ao de conflitos, esta pesquisa contribui para a literatura existente sobre o gerenciamento de conflitos e tem implica\c{c}\~oes pr\'aticas para o efetivo gerenciamento de conflitos no local de trabalho.

Resumen:
Esta investigaci\'on examina como las personas perciben y responden a conflictos potenciales en los entornos laborales. Cuando los individuos valoran mucho sus relaciones interpersonales con otros, pueden tener en cuenta los costos potenciales de las relaciones al decidir c\'omo manejar el conflicto. Proponemos que los individuos adoptan una perspectiva de evitaci\'on al conflicto para prevenir disrupciones en las relaciones a partir de confrontaci\'on. Espec\'ificamente, el valor que los individuos le dan a la armon\'ia superficial se relaciona positivamente con su anticipaci\'on negativa de los costos de la relaci\'on, la cual a cambio lleva a la evitaci\'on de conflictos. Adem\'as, la relaci\'on directa entre la armon\'ia superficial y la anticipaci\'on negativa y la relaci\'on indirecta entre la armon\'ia superficial y la evitaci\'on del conflicto son negativamente moderadas por la cercan\'ia de las relaciones entre las partes involucradas. Los resultados de estos dos estudios realizados en entornos laborales apoyaron nuestro modelo de mediaci\'on hipot\'etico. Resaltando el rol de la armon\'ia superficial en la evitaci\'on de conflicto, esta investigaci\'on contribuye a la literatura existente en gesti\'on del conflicto y tiene implicaciones pr\'acticas para gesti\'on efectiva del conflicto en el lugar de trabajo.},

  abstract = {Four studies investigated the causal link of affect intensity with risky decisions, and showed a striking contrast of life-saving and valuables-saving domains. When social distance is small people are more risk-seeking in the life-saving domain but less risk-seeking in the valuables-saving domain (Study 1), and the results remain robust under different framings (Study 2). Relatedly, people rely more on affective processing when social distance is small in the life-saving domain, but not in the valuables-saving domain (Study 3). Furthermore, in the life-saving domain social distance exerts an effect on risk preference under affective processing but not under deliberate processing, whereas, in the valuables-saving domain, social distance influences risk preference under deliberate processing but not under affective processing (Study 4). A unified, causal model of risky decisions is proposed to account for these findings and the fundamental differences among decision domains in light of their relationships with the affective processing. The model has a potential to generalize into other decision domains.},

In two experience sampling studies, 286 university students reported their self-control capacity and core affect for a week. Results revealed larger person-to-person than day-to-day variation in self-control capacity, while its moment-to-moment variation could be weakly modeled as a diurnal pattern. Interindividually, participants with higher self-control capacity were happier and less stressed, but intraindividually higher self-control capacity was mainly associated with higher alertness and energetic arousal. Our results imply that self-control capacity is better conceptualized as a composition of interrelated sub-constructs rather than as a unified resource.},

Three groups of Chinese learners of English (second? and fourth?year English majors and teachers of English) rated the acceptability of 48 un? prefixed verbs and their bare forms. Frequency of bare forms (e.g., close) was a factor associated with the preference of the fourth?year learners and the teachers to reject ungrammatical un? verbs (e.g., unclose). However, competing forms (e.g., open) did not appear to be linked to participants? judgments of the acceptability of ungrammatical un? verbs, lending support to the entrenchment rather than the preemption hypothesis. Ratings of the extent to which verbs incorporate the semantics of un? verbs emerged as significant predictors for the fourth?year learners? and the teachers? judgements of the acceptability of grammatical un? verbs, supporting the semantic verb class hypothesis.},

  abstract = {Functional connectivity pattern altered of default mode network (DMN) is gaining more attention as a potential noninvasive biomarker to diagnose incipient Alzheimer's disease. However, the changed functional connectivity except for DMN, the longitudinal changes in executive control network (ECN) and frontoparietal network (FPN) also has attracted wide interest. Moreover, AD-related functional connectivity abnormalities within the DMN are well replicated research, but the (increased/decreased and reduced) functional connectivity in ECN and FPN weren't receive adequate attention. To address the above issues, in this paper, we adopt sparse inverse covariance estimation (SICE) approach to investigate the changed functional connectivity of ECN and FPN on the ADNI2 dataset. Our experimental results indicate the left superior frontal gyrus (SFGmed.L) and left thalamus (THA.L) regions of ECN has shown increased functional connectivity, the left anterior cingulate (ACG.L) region of ECN has shown decreased functional connectivity. The Superior Parietal Gyrus (SPG) regions and left paracentral lobule (PCL.L) of FPN has shown increased functional connectivity, the left supramarginal gyrus (SMG.L) regions has shown decreased functional connectivity in AD patients. On the other hand, the ACG.L regions in ECN, SMG.L and left inferior parietal (IPL.L) in FPN have shown significantly reduced functional connectivity. These results demonstrate that increased/decreased functional connectivity and reduced functional connectivity not only within DMN, but also associated with ECN and FPN. It also suggest that AD is associated with the characteristics of large-scale functional networks, and these changed functional connectivity possibly as a potential noninvasive biomarker to diagnose incipient Alzheimer's disease.},

  abstract = {Glial glutamate transporter 1 (GLT-1) plays a vital role in the induction of brain ischemic tolerance (BIT) by ischemic preconditioning (IPC). However, the mechanism still needs to be further explained. The aim of this study was to investigate whether peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR{$\gamma$}) participates in regulating GLT-1 during the acquisition of BIT induced by IPC. Initially, cerebral IPC induced BIT and enhanced PPAR{$\gamma$} and GLT-1 expression in the CA1 hippocampus in rats. The ratio of nuclear/cytoplasmic PPAR{$\gamma$} was also increased. At the same time, the up-regulation of PPAR{$\gamma$} expression in astrocytes in the CA1 hippocampus was revealed by double immunofluorescence for PPAR{$\gamma$} and glial fibrillary acidic protein. Then, the mechanism by which PPAR{$\gamma$} regulates GLT-1 was studied in rat cortical astrocyte-neuron cocultures. We found that IPC [45 min of oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD)] protected neuronal survival after lethal OGD (4 h of OGD), which usually leads to neuronal death. The activation of PPAR{$\gamma$} occurred earlier than the up-regulation of GLT-1 in astrocytes after IPC, as determined by western blot and immunofluorescence. Moreover, the preadministration of the PPAR{$\gamma$} antagonist T0070907 or PPAR{$\gamma$} siRNA significantly attenuated GLT-1 up-regulation and the neuroprotective effects induced by IPC in vitro. Finally, the effect of the PPAR{$\gamma$} antagonist on GLT-1 expression and BIT was verified in vivo. We observed that the preadministration of T0070907 by intracerebroventricular injection dose-dependently attenuated the up-regulation of GLT-1 and BIT induced by cerebral IPC in rats. In conclusion, PPAR{$\gamma$} participates in regulating GLT-1 during the acquisition of BIT induced by IPC. Cover Image for this issue: doi: 10.1111/jnc.14532.

However, remarkably few empirical researches investigated possible psychological mechanism underlying the process. The purpose of the current research is to explore whether mindfulness can explain one pathway between authenticity and subjective well-being. By conducting a cross-sectional study and a time-lagged study, we verified that higher authenticity associated higher subjective well-being via higher mindfulness. Furthermore, the effect of authenticity on subjective well-being was specifically through two facets of mindfulness\textendash describing and acting-with-awareness. These results contribute to a better understanding of the association of authenticity and subjective well-being.

These goal orientations are linked with academic achievement, and troublingly, students report decreasing levels of goal orientations across the school years. However, little is known concerning the mechanisms that drive this decline. In a large (N = 891 twin pairs) cross-sectional genetically informative sample (age = 8 to 22 years), we found that older students reported lower goal orientations. Then, we identified shifts in the magnitude of genetic and environmental variance in each goal orientation. For example, variance in mastery goal orientation was primarily associated with environmental factors during the elementary school years. As students entered high school, genetic influences increased, replacing shared environmental influences. Finally, we situated these findings in the larger nomological network by testing associations with psychological constructs (e.g. personality and cognitive ability) and contextual variables (e.g. parents, schools, and peers). The development of academic motivation is complex with many interconnecting factors that appear to shift with age \textcopyright{} 2019 European Association of Personality Psychology},

In more economically prosperous families, schools, and nations, student interest was more strongly correlated with actual knowledge. Here, we investigated whether these results still held despite substantial changes to educational and economic systems over roughly a decade. Using similar data from PISA 2015 (N = 537,170), we found largely consistent results. Students from more economically advantaged homes, schools, and nations exhibited a stronger link between interests and knowledge. However, these moderation effects were substantially reduced, and the main effect of science interest increased by nearly 25\%, driven almost entirely by families of low socioeconomic status and nations with low gross domestic product. The interdependence of interests and resources is robust but perhaps weakening with educational progress.},

  abstract = {Hypoxic-ischemic brain damage (HIBD) which is a common cause of acute mortality and neurological dysfunction in neonates still lacks effective therapeutic methods. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) were demonstrated to play a crucial role in many diseases. To give a foundation for subsequent functional studies of lncRNAs in HIBD, we investigated the profiling of lncRNAs and messenger RNAs (mRNAs) using neonatal HIBD rat model. Six neonatal rats were divided into sham-operated group (n = 3) and HIBD group (n = 3) randomly. Deep RNA sequencing was implemented to find out the meaningful lncRNAs and mRNAs. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to validate expressions of lncRNAs and mRNAs. The Gene Ontology (GO) and kyoto encyclopedia of genes a genomes (KEGG) database were used to predict functions of lncRNAs. A total of 328 differentially expressed lncRNAs (177 down-regulated vs 151 up-regulated) and 7157 differentially expressed mRNAs (2552 down-regulated vs 4605 up-regulated) were identified. The Quantitative real-time PCR results showed significant differential expressions of five lncRNAs and five mRNAs which were consistent with the RNA-Seq data. Gene ontology and KEGG analysis showed these lncRNAs and their expression-correlated mRNAs were closely related to the Janus tyrosine kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) signaling pathway, NF-kappa B signaling pathway, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, calcium signaling pathway, Notch signaling pathway, mitogen activated protein kinase signaling pathway, neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction pathway and more. The results of our study identified the characterization and expression profiles of lncRNAs in neonatal HIBD and may be a basis for further therapeutic research.

These lines of evidence suggest critical roles of ER stress at the early stage of neurodegeneration, but the relevant mechanism is rarely exploited. In this study, we report that treatment with sublethal level of ER stressors, tunicamycin or brefeldin A, in primary rat neuronal cultures, significantly reduced dendrite arbor. Under the same treatment, either stressor reduced store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) and cytosolic calcium, [Ca2+]i, which were associated with autophagic degradation of stromal interaction molecule 2 (STIM2). Knockdown of ATG7 or activating transcription factor 4 completely reversed the reduction of STIM2 and significantly reversed the inhibition of SOCE under ER stress. Overexpression of STIM2 in neurons significantly prevented the ER stress-induced disruption of dendrite arbor. Altogether, our data reveal an unprecedented mechanism by which ER stress induces dendrite degeneration, that is, ER stress induces autophagic degradation of STIM2, leading to ensued SOCE inhibition and reduced [Ca2+]i, resulting in trimming effect on dendrites.},

  abstract = {Abstract Purkinje cell degeneration (pcd) was first identified in a spontaneous mouse mutant showing cerebellar ataxia. In addition to cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs), retinal photoreceptors, mitral cells in the olfactory bulb, and a discrete subpopulation of thalamic neurons also degenerate in the mutant brains. The gene responsible for the pcd mutant is Nna1, also known as ATP/GTP binding protein 1 or cytosolic carboxypeptidase-like 1, which encodes a zinc carboxypeptidase protein. To investigate pathogenesis of the pcd mutation in detail, we generated a conditional Nna1 allele targeting the carboxypeptidase domain at C-terminus. After Cre recombination and heterozygous crossing, we generated Nna1 knockout (KO) mice and found that the Nna1 KO mice began to show cerebellar ataxia at postnatal day 20 (P20). Most PCs degenerated until 4-week-old, except lobule X. Activated microglia and astrocytes were also observed in the Nna1 KO cerebellum. In the mutant brain, the Nna1 mRNA level was dramatically reduced, suggesting that nonsense-mediated mRNA decay occurs in it. Since the Nna1 protein acts as a de-glutamatase on the C-terminus of {$\alpha$}-tubulin and ?-tubulin, increased polyglutamylated tubulin was detected in the Nna1 KO cerebellum. In addition, the endoplasmic reticulum stress marker, C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), was up-regulated in the mutant PCs. We report the generation of a functional Nna1 conditional allele and possible mechanisms of PC death in the Nna1 KO in the cerebellum.

They could either infer the stranger's perspective by reading his or her facial expressions or simulate the stranger's perspective by watching the pictures he or she viewed. Predictors were substantially more accurate when they got perspective through simulation, but overestimated the accuracy they had achieved by inferring perspective. Predictors' miscalibrated confidence stemmed from overestimating the information revealed through facial expressions and underestimating the similarity in people's reactions to a given situation. People seem to underappreciate a useful strategy for understanding the minds of others, even after they gain firsthand experience with both strategies.},

In two experiments, participants were either instructed to intuitively or deliberatively select the most creative ideas from a pool of 18 ideas that systematically vary on creativity and its sub-dimensions originality and usefulness. Participants in the intuitive condition selected ideas that were more creative, more original, and equally useful than the ideas selected by participants in the deliberative condition.

  abstract = {The unfolded protein response (UPR) is one of the major cell-autonomous proteostatic stress responses. The UPR has been implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases and is therefore actively investigated as therapeutic target. In this respect, cell non-autonomous effects of the UPR including the reported cell-to-cell transmission of UPR activity may be highly important. A pharmaca-based UPR induction was employed to generate conditioned media (CM) from CM-donating neuronal (`donor') cells (SK-N-SH and primary mouse neurons). As previously reported, upon subsequent transfer of CM to naive neuronal `acceptor' cells, we confirmed UPR target mRNA and protein expression by qPCR and automated microscopy. However, UPR target gene expression was also induced in the absence of donor cells, indicating carry-over of pharmaca. Genetic induction of single pathways of the UPR in donor cells did not result in UPR transmission to acceptor cells. Moreover, no transmission was detected upon full UPR activation by nutrient deprivation or inducible expression of the heavy chain of immunoglobulin M in donor HeLa cells. In addition, in direct co-culture of donor cells expressing the immunoglobulin M heavy chain and fluorescent UPR reporter acceptor HeLa cells, UPR transmission was not observed. In conclusion, carry-over of pharmaca is a major confounding factor in pharmaca-based UPR transmission protocols that are therefore unsuitable to study cell-to-cell UPR transmission. In addition, the absence of UPR transmission in non-pharmaca-based models of UPR activation indicates that cell-to-cell UPR transmission does not occur in cell culture.},

The current study examined the relation between 66 preschool children's patterning skills and their general cognitive abilities, including fluid reasoning, working memory, and spatial skill. Further, the link between patterning and general math knowledge and specific math skills (i.e., numeracy and shape knowledge) was examined. Children's patterning skills were significantly but only moderately linked to their performance on general cognitive ability measures (e.g., fluid reasoning). Further, beyond the effects of these general cognitive abilities, patterning significantly predicted both general math and numeracy knowledge, as well as verbal calculation and magnitude comparison. Thus, although patterning skills related to measures of general cognitive ability, patterning was a unique contributor to children's general math and numeracy knowledge and specific math skills. Theories of math development and early math standards should thus be modified to emphasize the role of children's patterning skills to their math development.},

Yet the effects of the match between the response associated with the cued object's identity and the response associated with the target (compatibility effects), which are diagnostic of attentional engagement, were observed only with relevant-color onset cues. These findings demonstrate that stimulus- and goal-driven capture have qualitatively different consequences: Before attention is reoriented to the target, it is engaged to the location of the critical distractor following goal-driven capture but not stimulus-driven capture. The reported dissociation between attentional shifts and attentional engagement suggests that attention is best described as a camera: One can align its zoom lens without pressing the shutter button.},

Within-subject processes are proposed to explain between-subject associations of dispositional motives and relationship satisfaction. For an empirical test of the model, data on the dispositional partner-related need for communion and global relationship satisfaction were obtained from 152 individuals in heterosexual relationships. In an extensive experience sampling spanning 2 weeks, a subsample of 130 individuals answered questions about their current motivational states, mood, state relationship satisfaction, and experiences with their partner five times a day. The results were largely consistent with the DynaMoS model: (1) individuals with a strong dispositional implicit communion motive reported more often to be in a communal motivational state; (2) communally motivated individuals were more likely to engage in subsequent instrumental behaviour; and (3) relationship experiences that potentially satisfy communion motivation led to more positive relationship outcomes when individuals were motivated before compared with when they were not. It is discussed how these results and the experience sampling method can foster our understanding of how dispositional characteristics translate into everyday processes and shape relationship outcomes.
