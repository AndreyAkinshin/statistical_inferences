  abstract = {Applied Power Analysis for the Behavioral Sciences is a practical "how-to" guide to conducting statistical power analyses for psychology and related fields. The book provides a guide to conducting analyses that is appropriate for researchers and students, including those with limited quantitative backgrounds. With practical use in mind, the text provides detailed coverage of topics such as how to estimate expected effect sizes and power analyses for complex designs. The topical coverage of the text, an applied approach, in-depth coverage of popular statistical procedures, and a focus on conducting analyses using R make the text a unique contribution to the power literature. To facilitate application and usability, the text includes ready-to-use R code developed for the text. An accompanying R package called pwr2ppl (available at https://github.com/chrisaberson/pwr2ppl) provides tools for conducting power analyses across each topic covered in the text.},

  abstract = {When designing a study, the planned sample size is often based on power analyses. One way to choose an effect size for power analyses is by relying on pilot data. A-priori power analyses are only accurate when the effect size estimate is accurate. In this paper we highlight two sources of bias when performing a-priori power analyses for between-subject designs based on pilot data. First, we examine how the choice of the effect size index ({$\eta$}2, {$\omega$}2 and {$\epsilon$}2) affects the sample size and power of the main study. Based on our observations, we recommend against the use of {$\eta$}2 in a-priori power analyses. Second, we examine how the maximum sample size researchers are willing to collect in a main study (e.g. due to time or financial constraints) leads to overestimated effect size estimates in the studies that are performed. Determining the required sample size exclusively based on the effect size estimates from pilot data, and following up on pilot studies only when the sample size estimate for the main study is considered feasible, creates what we term follow-up bias. We explain how follow-up bias leads to underpowered main studies.
Our simulations show that designing main studies based on effect sizes estimated from small pilot studies does not yield desired levels of power due to accuracy bias and follow-up bias, even when publication bias is not an issue. We urge researchers to consider alternative approaches to determining the sample size of their studies, and discuss several options.},

  abstract = {When comparing two independent groups, psychology researchers commonly use Student's t-tests. Assumptions of normality and homogeneity of variance underlie this test. More often than not, when these conditions are not met, Student's t-test can be severely biased and lead to invalid statistical inferences. Moreover, we argue that the assumption of equal variances will seldom hold in psychological research, and choosing between Student's t-test and Welch's t-test based on the outcomes of a test of the equality of variances often fails to provide an appropriate answer. We show that the Welch's t-test provides a better control of Type 1 error rates when the assumption of homogeneity of variance is not met, and it loses little robustness compared to Student's t-test when the assumptions are met. We argue that Welch's t-test should be used as a default strategy.},

Under the null hypothesis, the P-value based on a continuous test statistic has a uniform distribution over the interval [0, 1], regardless of the sample size of the experiment. In contrast, the distribution of the P-value under the alternative hypothesis is a function of both sample size and the true value or range of true values of the tested parameter. The characteristics, such as mean and percentiles, of the P-value distribution can give valuable insight into how the P-value behaves for a variety of parameter values and sample sizes. Potential applications of the P-value distribution under the alternative hypothesis to the design, analysis, and interpretation of results of clinical trials are considered.},

  abstract = {Pilot studies represent a fundamental phase of the research process. The purpose of conducting a pilot study is to examine the feasibility of an approach that is intended to be used in a larger scale study. The roles and limitations of pilot studies are described here using a clinical trial as an example. A pilot study can be used to evaluate the feasibility of recruitment, randomization, retention, assessment procedures, new methods, and implementation of the novel intervention., A pilot study is not a hypothesis testing study. Safety, efficacy and effectiveness are not evaluated in a pilot. Contrary to tradition, a pilot study does not provide a meaningful effect size estimate for planning subsequent studies due to the imprecision inherent in data from small samples. Feasibility results do not necessarily generalize beyond the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the pilot design., A pilot study is a requisite initial step in exploring a novel intervention or an innovative application of an intervention. Pilot results can inform feasibility and identify modifications needed in the design of a larger, ensuing hypothesis testing study. Investigators should be forthright in stating these objectives of a pilot study. Grant reviewers and other stakeholders should expect no more.},

  abstract = {Designing Experiments and Analyzing Data: A Model Comparison Perspective (3rd edition) offers an integrative conceptual framework for understanding experimental design and data analysis. Maxwell, Delaney, and Kelley first apply fundamental principles to simple experimental designs followed by an application of the same principles to more complicated designs. Their integrative conceptual framework better prepares readers to understand the logic behind a general strategy of data analysis that is appropriate for a wide variety of designs, which allows for the introduction of more complex topics that are generally omitted from other books. Numerous pedagogical features further facilitate understanding: examples of published research demonstrate the applicability of each chapter's content; flowcharts assist in choosing the most appropriate procedure; end-of-chapter lists of important formulas highlight key ideas and assist readers in locating the initial presentation of equations; useful programming code and tips are provided throughout the book and in associated resources available online, and extensive sets of exercises help develop a deeper understanding of the subject. Detailed solutions for some of the exercises and realistic data sets are included on the website (DesigningExperiments.com). The pedagogical approach used throughout the book enables readers to gain an overview of experimental design, from conceptualization of the research question to analysis of the data. The book and its companion website with web apps, tutorials, and detailed code are ideal for students and researchers seeking the optimal way to design their studies and analyze the resulting data.},
