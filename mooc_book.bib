  abstract = {When comparing two independent groups, psychology researchers commonly use Student's t-tests. Assumptions of normality and homogeneity of variance underlie this test. More often than not, when these conditions are not met, Student's t-test can be severely biased and lead to invalid statistical inferences. Moreover, we argue that the assumption of equal variances will seldom hold in psychological research, and choosing between Student's t-test and Welch's t-test based on the outcomes of a test of the equality of variances often fails to provide an appropriate answer. We show that the Welch's t-test provides a better control of Type 1 error rates when the assumption of homogeneity of variance is not met, and it loses little robustness compared to Student's t-test when the assumptions are met. We argue that Welch's t-test should be used as a default strategy.},

  abstract = {The P-value is a random variable derived from the distribution of the test statistic used to analyze a data set and to test a null hypothesis. Under the null hypothesis, the P-value based on a continuous test statistic has a uniform distribution over the interval [0, 1], regardless of the sample size of the experiment. In contrast, the distribution of the P-value under the alternative hypothesis is a function of both sample size and the true value or range of true values of the tested parameter. The characteristics, such as mean and percentiles, of the P-value distribution can give valuable insight into how the P-value behaves for a variety of parameter values and sample sizes. Potential applications of the P-value distribution under the alternative hypothesis to the design, analysis, and interpretation of results of clinical trials are considered.},
