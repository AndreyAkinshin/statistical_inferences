In this study, we examined, empirically, the treatment and evidential impact of nonsignificant results. Our specific goals were twofold: to explore how psychologists interpret and communicate nonsignificant results and to assess how much these results constitute evidence in favor of the null hypothesis. First, we examined all nonsignificant findings mentioned in the abstracts of the 2015 volumes of Psychonomic Bulletin \& Review, Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, and Psychological Science (N = 137). In 72\% of these cases, nonsignificant results were misinterpreted, in that the authors inferred that the effect was absent. Second, a Bayes factor reanalysis revealed that fewer than 5\% of the nonsignificant findings provided strong evidence (i.e., BF01 {$>$} 10) in favor of the null hypothesis over the alternative hypothesis. We recommend that researchers expand their statistical tool kit in order to correctly interpret nonsignificant results and to be able to evaluate the evidence for and against the null hypothesis.},

However, in this article, we show that in some situations, p-curve behaves erratically, whereas p-uniform may yield implausible estimates of negative effect size. Moreover, we show that (and explain why) p-curve and p-uniform result in overestimation of effect size under moderate-to-large heterogeneity and may yield unpredictable bias when researchers employ p-hacking. We offer hands-on recommendations on applying and interpreting results of meta-analyses in general and p-uniform and p-curve in particular. Both methods as well as traditional methods are applied to a meta-analysis on the effect of weight on judgments of importance. We offer guidance for applying p-uniform or p-curve using R and a user-friendly web application for applying p-uniform.},

  abstract = {Magnitude based inference (MBI) is a statistical procedure that successfully introduced researchers to statistical tools other than null hypothesis significance tests. However, it has been criticised for mixing Bayesian and frequentist thinking and for encouraging researchers to run small studies with high Type 1 error rates. We formally describe MBI as a decision procedure that combines one-sided hypotheses tested at multiple alpha levels. The hypotheses concern the presence or absence of meaningful effects. When testing is limited to a single alpha level, this formalisation of MBI reduces to a well-known multiple decision procedure that combines minimal effects tests and equivalence testing. To put MBI on a formal frequentist footing with transparent error control, we recommend replacing mechanistic (non-clinical) MBI with these established tests, and replacing clinical MBI with a pair of one-sided tests at asymmetric alpha levels. These tests can be run using standard statistical software, or the p-values required can be obtained from the spreadsheets that implement MBI. We recommend dropping other MBI outputs, including Bayesian interpretations and testing at multiple alpha levels. New sample size calculators are also required. Researchers should pre-specify their hypotheses and alpha levels, perform a priori sample size calculations, and justify all assumptions. With our recommended changes, researchers can make statistical inferences about their data in relation to meaningful effect sizes while controlling error rates.},

  abstract = {When designing a study, the planned sample size is often based on power analyses. One way to choose an effect size for power analyses is by relying on pilot data. A-priori power analyses are only accurate when the effect size estimate is accurate. In this paper we highlight two sources of bias when performing a-priori power analyses for between-subject designs based on pilot data. First, we examine how the choice of the effect size index ({$\eta$}2, {$\omega$}2 and {$\epsilon$}2) affects the sample size and power of the main study. Based on our observations, we recommend against the use of {$\eta$}2 in a-priori power analyses. Second, we examine how the maximum sample size researchers are willing to collect in a main study (e.g. due to time or financial constraints) leads to overestimated effect size estimates in the studies that are performed. Determining the required sample size exclusively based on the effect size estimates from pilot data, and following up on pilot studies only when the sample size estimate for the main study is considered feasible, creates what we term follow-up bias. We explain how follow-up bias leads to underpowered main studies.
Our simulations show that designing main studies based on effect sizes estimated from small pilot studies does not yield desired levels of power due to accuracy bias and follow-up bias, even when publication bias is not an issue. We urge researchers to consider alternative approaches to determining the sample size of their studies, and discuss several options.},

  abstract = {According to a growing consensus, the Stroop effect is understood as a phenomenon of conflict and cognitive control. A tidal wave of recent research alleges that incongruent Stroop stimuli generate conflict, which is then managed and resolved by top-down cognitive control. We argue otherwise: Control studies fail to account for major Stroop results obtained over a century-long history of research. We list some of the most compelling developments and show that no control account can serve as a viable explanation for major Stroop-phenomena and that there exist more parsimonious explanations for other Stroop-related phenomena. Against a wealth of studies and emerging consensus, we posit that data-driven selective attention best accounts for the gamut of existing Stroop results. The case for data-driven attention is not new: A mere twenty-some years ago the Stroop effect was considered "the gold standard" of attention (MacLeod, 1992). We identify four pitfalls plaguing control studies of the Stroop effect and show that the notion of top-down control is gratuitous. Looking at the Stroop effect from a historical perspective, we argue that the recent paradigm change from attention to control is unwarranted. Applying Occam's razor, the effects marshaled in support of the control view are better explained by a selectivity of attention account. Moreover, many Stroop results, ignored in the control literature, are inconsistent with any control account of the effect.},

This places researchers in a difficult position. In response, the authors advocate an approach to designing studies that considers statistical power and financial concerns simultaneously. Their purpose is twofold: (a) to introduce the general paradigm of cost optimization in the context of power analysis and (b) to present techniques for such optimization. Techniques are presented in the context of a randomized clinical trial. The authors consider (a) selecting optimal cutpoints for subject screening tests; (b) optimally allocating subjects to different treatment conditions; (c) choosing between obtaining more subjects or taking more replicate measurements; and (d) using prerandomization covariates.

What should we think about a doctor who uses the wrong treatment, either wilfully or through ignorance, or who uses the right treatment wrongly (such as by giving the wrong dose of a drug)? Most people would agree that such behaviour was unprofessional, arguably unethical, and certainly unacceptable.

What, then, should we think about researchers who use the wrong techniques (either wilfully or in ignorance), use the right techniques wrongly, misinterpret their results, report their results selectively, cite the literature selectively, and draw unjustified conclusions? We should be appalled. Yet numerous studies of the medical literature, in both general and specialist journals, have shown that all of the above phenomena are common.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 This is surely a scandal.

Although a significant result in a large study may sometimes not be clinically important, a far greater problem arises from misinterpretation of non-significant findings. By convention a P value greater than 5\% (P{$>$}0.05) is called ``not significant.'' Randomised controlled clinical trials that do not show a significant difference between the treatments being compared are often called ``negative.'' This term wrongly implies that the study has shown that there is no difference, whereas usually all that has been shown is an absence of evidence of a difference. These are quite different statements.

The sample size of controlled trials is generally inadequate, with a consequent lack of power to detect real, and clinically worthwhile, differences in treatment. Freiman et al1 found that only \ldots},

  abstract = {We measure how accurately replication of experimental results can be predicted by a black-box statistical model. With data from four large- scale replication projects in experimental psychology and economics, and techniques from machine learning, we train a predictive model and study which variables drive predictable replication.

The model predicts binary replication with a cross validated accuracy rate of 70\% (AUC of 0.79) and relative effect size with a Spearman {$\rho$} of 0.38. The accuracy level is similar to the market-aggregated beliefs of peer scientists (Camerer et al., 2016; Dreber et al., 2015). The predictive power is validated in a pre-registered out of sample test of the outcome of Camerer et al. (2018b), where 71\% (AUC of 0.73) of replications are predicted correctly and effect size correlations amount to {$\rho$} = 0.25.

Basic features such as the sample and effect sizes in original papers, and whether reported effects are single-variable main effects or two- variable interactions, are predictive of successful replication. The models presented in this paper are simple tools to produce cheap, prognostic replicability metrics. These models could be useful in institutionalizing the process of evaluation of new findings and guiding resources to those direct replications that are likely to be most informative.},

  abstract = {Replication failures of past findings in several scientific disciplines, including psychology, medicine, and experimental economics, have created a ``crisis of confidence'' among scientists. Psychological science has been at the forefront of tackling these issues, with discussions about replication failures and scientific self-criticisms of questionable research practices (QRPs) increasingly taking place in public forums. How this replicability crisis impacts the public's trust is a question yet to be answered by research. Whereas some researchers believe that the public's trust will be positively impacted or maintained, others believe trust will be diminished. Because it is our field of expertise, we focus on trust in psychological science. We performed a study testing how public trust in past and future psychological research would be impacted by being informed about (i) replication failures (replications group), (ii) replication failures and criticisms of QRPs (QRPs group), and (iii) replication failures, criticisms of QRPs, and proposed reforms (reforms group). Results from a mostly European sample (N = 1129) showed that, compared to a control group, people in the replications, QRPs, and reforms groups self-reported less trust in past research. Regarding trust in future research, the replications and QRPs groups did not significantly differ from the control group. Surprisingly, the reforms group had less trust in future research than the control group. Nevertheless, people in the replications, QRPs, and reforms groups did not significantly differ from the control group in how much they believed future research in psychological science should be supported by public funding. Potential explanations are discussed.},

  abstract = {Replication failures of past findings in several scientific disciplines, including psychology, medicine, and experimental economics, have created a ``crisis of confidence'' among scientists. Psychological science has been at the forefront of tackling these issues, with discussions about replication failures and scientific self-criticisms of questionable research practices (QRPs) increasingly taking place in public forums. How this replicability crisis impacts the public's trust is a question yet to be answered by research. Whereas some researchers believe that the public's trust will be positively impacted or maintained, others believe trust will be diminished. Because it is our field of expertise, we focus on trust in psychological science. We performed a study testing how public trust in past and future psychological research would be impacted by being informed about (i) replication failures (replications group), (ii) replication failures and criticisms of QRPs (QRPs group), and (iii) replication failures, criticisms of QRPs, and proposed reforms (reforms group). Results from a mostly European sample (N = 1129) showed that, compared to a control group, people in the replications, QRPs, and reforms groups self-reported less trust in past research. Regarding trust in future research, the replications and QRPs groups did not significantly differ from the control group. Surprisingly, the reforms group had less trust in future research than the control group. Nevertheless, people in the replications, QRPs, and reforms groups did not significantly differ from the control group in how much they believed future research in psychological science should be supported by public funding. Potential explanations are discussed.},

  abstract = {Effect sizes are an important outcome of quantitative research because they allow researchers to communicate the practical significance of the findings. However, there are few guides for psychological researchers that explain how they can quantify which effect sizes are practically meaningful, and which are not. Being able to specify the smallest effect size that is considered practically meaningful facilitates the design of well-powered experiments and enables researchers to falsify predictions by rejecting effects larger than this effect size. We illustrate two methods used in clinical research to determine the minimally detectable difference: the smallest effect size that is associated with a subjectively noticeable change at the individual level. These anchor-based methods provide one possible approach for researchers to determine their smallest effect size of interest, and to interpret the effect size estimates observed in research lines. We discuss the limitations of applying anchor-based methods in psychology, and point out there is ample room for statistical and methodological improvement, but also highlight the potential for anchor-based methods to provide one approach to establish a smallest effect of interest in lines of research.},

  abstract = {Recent psychological research has experienced a stark increase in the use of repeated subjective reports, such as online, smartphone-based daily diaries. This development holds great opportunities to study causal processes and developmental change, but it also brings new challenges. As is often the case in psychology, interest in specific substantive questions can outrun measurement research, so that many measurement and design decisions are made ad hoc and not evaluated rigorously. Recent work has added initial elevation bias to the list of common pitfalls that should be avoided when using subjective reports. Initial elevation bias refers to the phenomenon that negative states (i.e, thoughts, feelings, behaviors) in subjective reports are elevated when first assessed, as compared to later assessments. In this article, we employ a planned missingness design in a daily diary study of more than 1,200 individuals that were assessed over a period of up to 70 days to estimate and adjust for initial elevation bias. First, we found only a negligible bias related to initial presentation and item order: items were not answered differently depending on when and where they were shown. Second, we show that residualising these biases had minor effects. We conclude from our findings that the initial elevation bias may be more limited than previously reported and may only act at the level of the survey, not at the item level. We encourage researchers to make design choices that will allow them to routinely ascertain potential measurement reactivity biases empirically in their studies. Specifically, we advocate that researchers should routinely randomise item display and order in planned missingness designs, so that they can estimate biases affecting subjective reports. Another benefit of routinely randomizing item display is that it allows constructing brief survey instruments without compromising the construct breadth and the number of constructs covered.},

Some of these consequences have recently been shown to go beyond the dyad. That is, interpersonal mimicry not only affects the way we feel towards our immediate interaction partner, but also affects our feelings and behavior towards other people in general. The goal of the present research is to understand why it is that nonconscious mimicry has consequences that go beyond the dyad. Specifically, it is hypothesized and found that that being mimicked during social interaction shifts self-construals such that they become more interdependent and ``other-oriented'' (Study 1). Accordingly, interpersonal mimicry heightens one's perception of interpersonal closeness with non-specified others (Study 2) and decreases one's physical proximity to others (Study 3). In a final experiment (Study 4), the impact of mimicry on self-construal is shown to mediate the positive social consequences of mimicry.},

Based on their simulation study they concluded that ``selective publishing yields a more accurate meta-analytic estimation of the true effect than publishing everything, (and that) publishing nonreplicable results while placing null results in the file drawer can be beneficial for the scientific collective'' (p.4).    Methods and Findings  Using their scenario with a small to medium population effect size, we show that publishing everything is more effective for the scientific collective than selective publishing of significant results. Additionally, we examined a scenario with a null effect, which provides a more dramatic illustration of the superiority of publishing everything over selective publishing.    Conclusion  Publishing everything is more effective than only reporting significant outcomes.},

  abstract = {The conventional approach of choosing sample size to provide 80\% or greater power ignores the cost implications of different sample size choices. Costs, however, are often impossible for investigators and funders to ignore in actual practice. Here, we propose and justify a new approach for choosing sample size based on cost efficiency, the ratio of a study's projected scientific and/or practical value to its total cost. By showing that a study's projected value exhibits diminishing marginal returns as a function of increasing sample size for a wide variety of definitions of study value, we are able to develop two simple choices that can be defended as more cost efficient than any larger sample size. The first is to choose the sample size that minimizes the average cost per subject. The second is to choose sample size to minimize total cost divided by the square root of sample size. This latter method is theoretically more justifiable for innovative studies, but also performs reasonably well and has some justification in other cases. For example, if projected study value is assumed to be proportional to power at a specific alternative and total cost is a linear function of sample size, then this approach is guaranteed either to produce more than 90\% power or to be more cost efficient than any sample size that does. These methods are easy to implement, based on reliable inputs, and well justified, so they should be regarded as acceptable alternatives to current conventional approaches.},

Experiment 2 added random generation of letters as a secondary task to paced card sorting. Information load per card was varied from 1 through 2 to 4 to 8 alternatives, with sorting rate held constant. As predicted, the redundancy of the sequences generated increased linearly with sorting load. Experiment 3 varied number of items to be randomized. Rate of random generation increased systematically from 2 to 4 to 8 alternatives, but levelled out beyond this point, showing no difference between 16 and 26.

  abstract = {It is regarded as best practice for psychologists to report effect size when disseminating quantitative research findings. Reporting of effect size in the psychological literature is patchy \textendash{} though this may be changing \textendash{} and when reported it is far from clear that appropriate effect size statistics are employed. This paper considers the practice of reporting point estimates of standardized effect size and explores factors such as reliability, range restriction and differences in design that distort standardized effect size unless suitable corrections are employed. For most purposes simple (unstandardized) effect size is more robust and versatile than standardized effect size. Guidelines for deciding what effect size metric to use and how to report it are outlined. Foremost among these are: (i) a preference for simple effect size over standardized effect size, and (ii) the use of confidence intervals to indicate a plausible range of values the effect might take. Deciding on the appropriate effect size statistic to report always requires careful thought and should be influenced by the goals of the researcher, the context of the research and the potential needs of readers.},

  abstract = {Previous research (Chartrand \& Bargh, 1999; Study 2) has demonstrated social influence in response to a ``chameleon effect''; a confederate who mimicked participants was liked more than a confederate who did not, despite the fact that participants did not explicitly notice the mimicry. In the current study, participants interacted with an embodied artificial intelligence agent in immersive virtual reality. The agent either mimicked a participant's head movements at a four second delay or utilized pre-recorded movements of another participant as it verbally presented an argument. Mimicking agents were more persuasive and likeable than non-mimickers despite participants' inability to explicitly detect the mimic. These data are uniquely powerful because they demonstrate the ability to use automatic, indiscriminate mimicking (i.e., a computer algorithm blindly applied to all movements) to gain social influence. Furthermore, this is the first study to demonstrate social influence effects with a nonhuman, nonverbal mimicker.},

We discuss a CVE-based research paradigm that transforms (i.e., filters and modifies) nonverbal behaviors during social interaction. Because the technology underlying CVEs allows a strategic decoupling of rendered behavior from the actual behavior of the interactants, conceptual and perceptual constraints inherent in face-to-face interaction need not apply. Decoupling algorithms can enhance or degrade facets of nonverbal behavior within CVEs, such that interactants can reap the benefits of nonverbal enhancement or suffer nonverbal degradation. Concepts underlying transformed social interaction (TSI), the ethics and implications of such a research paradigm, and data from a pilot study examining TSI are discussed.},

  abstract = {If science were a game, a dominant rule would probably be to collect results that are statistically significant. Several reviews of the psychological literature have shown that around 96\% of papers involving the use of null hypothesis significance testing report significant outcomes for their main results but that the typical studies are insufficiently powerful for such a track record. We explain this paradox by showing that the use of several small underpowered samples often represents a more efficient research strategy (in terms of finding p {$<$} .05) than does the use of one larger (more powerful) sample. Publication bias and the most efficient strategy lead to inflated effects and high rates of false positives, especially when researchers also resorted to questionable research practices, such as adding participants after intermediate testing. We provide simulations that highlight the severity of such biases in meta-analyses. We consider 13 meta-analyses covering 281 primary studies in various fields of psychology and find indications of biases and/or an excess of significant results in seven. These results highlight the need for sufficiently powerful replications and changes in journal policies.},

  abstract = {Rhythmic flexion-extensions of ipsilateral hand and foot are easily performed ("easy" association) when the two segments are moved in phase (isodirectionally), whereas great care and attention are required ("difficult" association) to move them in phase opposition. We searched for features distinguishing the two types of coupling by analyzing, on ten subjects: 1) the frequency limit in each association; and, 2) if coupling is modified by inertial or elastic loading of the hand. 1) Subjects were asked to oscillate hand and foot at various paced frequencies, in the easy or in the difficult association for one minute at least. In the easy coupling, the task was performed up to 2.0-2.5 Hz, the duration being thereafter shortened by muscular fatigue. In the difficult coupling when the frequency was increased above 0.7 1.7 Hz, the performance rapidly shortened, not because of fatigue but because of an inevitable reversal to the in-phase movement. The frequency-duration curve always followed a similar decay, although it covered different frequency ranges in the various subjects. 2) The effect of charging the hand with inertial or elastic loads was studied at the subject's preferred frequency, chosen when the hand was unloaded. Without loading, in the easy association the hand cycle slightly lagged the foot cycle while in the difficult one an almost perfect phase opposition was maintained. Under inertial load (inertial momentum: 9 gm2), in the easy association the hand lag was increased by l0 \textasciitilde{} to 45\textasciitilde{} despite a compensatory advanced activation of the forearm EMG; in the difficult association, instead, the hand lag was small (less than 10\textasciitilde{} thanks to an even earlier onset of the forearm EMG. The elastic load (torque: 4 gm) had negligible effects on the phase relation between movements but improved the phase relation between EMGs. These findings show that coupling is tighter in the difficult than in the easy association, a feature that is emphasized by the effect of the load. This supports the idea that kinaesthetic afferences have more pronounced influences on control of the anti-phase than the in-phase coupling.},

This matching of observed actions on the observer's motor repertoire could be at the basis of action recognition. Here we investigated if action observation, in addition to cortical motor areas, involves also low level motor structures mimicking the observed actions as if they were performed by the observer. Spinal cord excitability was tested by eliciting the H-re\textasciimacron ex in a \textregistered nger \textasciimacron exor muscle (\textasciimacron exor digitorum super\textregistered cialis) in humans looking at goal-directed hand actions presented on a TV screen. We found that, in the absence of any detectable muscle activity, there was in the observers a signi\textregistered cant modulation of the monosynaptic re\textasciimacron ex size, speci\textregistered cally related to the different phases of the observed movement. The recorded H-re\textasciimacron ex rapidly increased in size during hand opening, it was depressed during hand closing and quickly recovered during object lifting. This modulation pattern is, however, opposite to that occurring when the recorded muscles are actually executing the observed action [Lemon et al. (1995) J. Neurosci., 15, 6145{$\pm$}56]. Considering that, when investigated at cortical level the modulation pattern of corticospinal excitability replicates the observed movements [Fadiga et al. (1995) J. Neurophysiol., 73, 2608{$\pm$}2611], this spinal `inverted mirror' behaviour might be \textregistered nalised to prevent the overt replica of the seen action.},

However, to be well designed, these incentives must take into account the motivations, goals and views of the basic scientists. In the paper we present the results of an investigation that involved more than 300 scientists at Harvard Medical School and affiliated institutes. The results of this study suggest that some soft incentives could be valuable tools to increase the transformative value of fundamental investigations without affecting the spirit of the basic research and scientists' work satisfaction. After discussing the findings, we discuss a few examples of nudges for basic researchers in the biomedical fields.},

  abstract = {We describe and demonstrate an empirical strategy useful for discovering and replicating empirical effects in psychological science. The method involves the design of a metastudy, in which many independent experimental variables\textemdash that may be moderators of an empirical effect\textemdash are indiscriminately randomized. Radical randomization yields rich datasets that can be used to test the robustness of an empirical claim to some of the vagaries and idiosyncrasies of experimental protocols and enhances the generalizability of these claims. The strategy is made feasible by advances in hierarchical Bayesian modeling that allow for the pooling of information across unlike experiments and designs and is proposed here as a gold standard for replication research and exploratory research. The practical feasibility of the strategy is demonstrated with a replication of a study on subliminal priming.},

  abstract = {To understand the origin and development of implicit attitudes, we measured race attitudes in White American 6-year-olds, 10-year-olds, and adults by first developing a child-oriented version of the Implicit Association Test (Child IAT). Remarkably, implicit pro-White/ anti-Black bias was evident even in the youngest group, with self-reported attitudes revealing bias in the same direction. In 10-year-olds and adults, the same magnitude of implicit race bias was observed, although self-reported race attitudes became substantially less biased in older children and vanished entirely in adults, who self-reported equally favorable attitudes toward Whites and Blacks. These data are the first to show an asymmetry in the development of implicit and explicit race attitudes, with explicit attitudes becoming more egalitarian and implicit attitudes remaining stable and favoring the in-group across development. We offer a tentative suggestion that mean levels of implicit and explicit attitudes diverge around age 10.},

However, many researchers do not seem to appreciate how random effects structures affect the generalizability of an analysis. Here, we argue that researchers using LMEMs for confirmatory hypothesis testing should minimally adhere to the standards that have been in place for many decades. Through theoretical arguments and Monte Carlo simulation, we show that LMEMs generalize best when they include the maximal random effects structure justified by the design. The generalization performance of LMEMs including data-driven random effects structures strongly depends upon modeling criteria and sample size, yielding reasonable results on moderately-sized samples when conservative criteria are used, but with little or no power advantage over maximal models. Finally, random-intercepts-only LMEMs used on within-subjects and/or within-items data from populations where subjects and/or items vary in their sensitivity to experimental manipulations always generalize worse than separate F1 and F2 tests, and in many cases, even worse than F1 alone. Maximal LMEMs should be the `gold standard' for confirmatory hypothesis testing in psycholinguistics and beyond.},

  abstract = {Organisms engage in various activities that are directed at objects, whether real or imagined. Such activities cab be called "intentional relations." We present a four-level framework for social understanding which organizes the ways in which social organisms represent their own intentional relations those of other agents. The information available to an organism about its own intentional relations (or first person information) is qualitatively different from the information available to that organism about other agents' intentional relations (or third person information). Through the integration of these two sources of information, it is possible to generate representations of intentional relations that are uniformly applicable to the activities of both self and other. The four levels of the framework differ in the extent to which such integration occurs and in the degree to which imagination is involved in generating these representations. Most animals are at the lowest level, at which integration of first and third person sources of information does not occur. Among nonhuman species, only great apes exhibit social understanding at intermediate levels, at which integration of these sources of information provides uniform representations of intentional relations. Only humans attain the highest level, at which it is possible to represent intentional relations to mental objects. We propose that with the development of the imagination, children progress through three stages, equivalent to the later three levels of the framework. The abnormalities in social understanding of autistic individuals may result from a failure to develop integrated representations of intentional relations.},

  abstract = {Prior to the twentieth century, theories of knowledge were inherently perceptual. Since then, developments in logic, statistics, and programming languages have inspired amodal theories that rest on principles fundamentally different from those underlying perception. In addition, perceptual approaches have become widely viewed as untenable because they are assumed to implement recording systems, not conceptual systems. A perceptual theory of knowledge is developed here in the context of current cognitive science and neuroscience. During perceptual experience, association areas in the brain capture bottom-up patterns of activation in sensory-motor areas. Later, in a top-down manner, association areas partially reactivate sensory-motor areas to implement perceptual symbols. The storage and reactivation of perceptual symbols operates at the level of perceptual components \textendash{} not at the level of holistic perceptual experiences. Through the use of selective attention, schematic representations of perceptual components are extracted from experience and stored in memory (e.g., individual memories of green, purr, hot). As memories of the same component become organized around a common frame, they implement a simulator that produces limitless simulations of the component (e.g., simulations of purr). Not only do such simulators develop for aspects of sensory experience, they also develop for aspects of proprioception (e.g., lift, run) and introspection (e.g., compare, memory, happy, hungry). Once established, these simulators implement a basic conceptual system that represents types, supports categorization, and produces categorical inferences. These simulators further support productivity, propositions, and abstract concepts, thereby implementing a fully functional conceptual system. Productivity results from integrating simulators combinatorially and recursively to produce complex simulations. Propositions result from binding simulators to perceived individuals to represent type-token relations. Abstract concepts are grounded in complex simulations of combined physical and introspective events. Thus, a perceptual theory of knowledge can implement a fully functional conceptual system while avoiding problems associated with amodal symbol systems. Implications for cognition, neuroscience, evolution, development, and artificial intelligence are explored.},

First, we show that a new estimation method using expectation-maximization outperforms the kernel-density approach of z-curve.1.0. Second, we examine the coverage of bootstrapped confidence intervals to provide information about the uncertainty in z-curve estimates. Third, we extended z-curve to estimate the number of all studies that were conducted, including studies with non-significant results that may not have been reported, solely on the basis of significant results. This allows us to estimate the EDR; that is, the percentage of significant results that were obtained in all studies. EDR can be used to assess the size of the file-drawer, estimate the maximum number of false positive results, and may provide a better estimate of the success rate in actual replication studies than the ERR because exact replications are impossible.},

  abstract = {A study of a sample provides only an estimate of the true (population) value of an outcome statistic. A report of the study therefore usually includes an inference about the true value. Traditionally, a researcher makes an inference by declaring the value of the statistic statistically significant or non significant on the basis of a P value derived from a null-hypothesis test. This approach is confusing and can be misleading, depending on the magnitude of the statistic, error of measurement, and sample size. The authors use a more intuitive and practical approach based directly on uncertainty in the true value of the statistic. First they express the uncertainty as confidence limits, which define the likely range of the true value. They then deal with the real-world relevance of this uncertainty by taking into account values of the statistic that are substantial in some positive and negative sense, such as beneficial or harmful. If the likely range overlaps substantially positive and negative values, they infer that the outcome is unclear; otherwise, they infer that the true value has the magnitude of the observed value: substantially positive, trivial, or substantially negative. They refine this crude inference by stating qualitatively the likelihood that the true value will have the observed magnitude (eg, very likely beneficial). Quantitative or qualitative probabilities that the true value has the other 2 magnitudes or more finely graded magnitudes (such as trivial, small, moderate, and large) can also be estimated to guide a decision about the utility of the outcome.},

Equivalence in location and variability is established if all four tests lead to a rejection at the (one-sided) level {$\alpha$}. A conservative procedure ``correcting'' the t-tests for heteroscedasticity is derived. The choice of a design in terms of the global level {$\alpha$}, the global power, the relevant deviations in the population means and variances, as well as the sample size is outlined. Numerical calculations of the actual level and power for the proposed designs show, that for balanced sample sizes the classical uncorrected one-sided t-tests can be used safely without exaggerating the global type I error probability. Finally an example is given.},

  abstract = {Social psychology's current crisis has prompted calls for larger samples and more replications. Building on Sakaluk's (in this issue) distinction between exploration and confirmation, I argue that this shift will increase correctness of findings, but at the expense of exploration and discovery. The likely effects on the field include aversion to risk, increased difficulty in building careers and hence more capricious hiring and promotion policies, loss of interdisciplinary influence, and rising interest in small, weak findings. Winners (who stand to gain from the mooted changes) include researchers with the patience and requisite resources to assemble large samples; incompetent experimenters; destructive iconoclasts; competing subfields of psychology; and lower-ranked journals, insofar as they publish creative work with small samples. The losers are young researchers; writers of literature reviews and textbooks; flamboyant, creative researchers with lesser levels of patience; and researchers at small colleges. My position is that the field has actually done quite well in recent decades, and improvement should be undertaken as further refinement of a successful approach, in contrast to the Cassandrian view that the field's body of knowledge is hopelessly flawed and radical, revolutionary change is needed. I recommend we retain the exploratory research approach alongside the new, large-sample confirmatory work.},

Skilled and novice typists picked which of two letter dyads they preferred. In each pair, one dyad, if typed using standard typing methods, would involve the same fingers (e.g., FV); the other would be typed with different fingers (e.g., FJ). Thus, if typed, dyads of the former kind should create more motor interference than dyads of the latter kind. Although individuals could not explain how the dyads differed, skilled typists preferred those typed with different fingers. Novices showed no preference. Moreover, a motor task performed while making dyad preference judgments attenuated skilled typists' preference\textemdash but only when the motor task involved the specific fingers that would be used to type the dyads. These findings suggest that in skilled typists, perceiving letters prompts covert sensorimotor simulation of typing them, which in turn influences affective judgments about this information.},

  abstract = {The term psi denotes anomalous processes of information or energy transfer that are currently unexplained in terms of known physical or biological mechanisms. Two variants of psi are precognition (conscious cognitive awareness) and premonition (affective apprehension) of a future event that could not otherwise be anticipated through any known inferential process. Precognition and premonition are themselves special cases of a more general phenomenon: the anomalous retroactive influence of some future event on an individual's current responses, whether those responses are conscious or nonconscious, cognitive or affective. This article reports 9 experiments, involving more than 1,000 participants, that test for retroactive influence by "time-reversing" well-established psychological effects so that the individual's responses are obtained before the putatively causal stimulus events occur. Data are presented for 4 time-reversed effects: precognitive approach to erotic stimuli and precognitive avoidance of negative stimuli; retroactive priming; retroactive habituation; and retroactive facilitation of recall. The mean effect size (d) in psi performance across all 9 experiments was 0.22, and all but one of the experiments yielded statistically significant results. The individual-difference variable of stimulus seeking, a component of extraversion, was significantly correlated with psi performance in 5 of the experiments, with participants who scored above the midpoint on a scale of stimulus seeking achieving a mean effect size of 0.43. Skepticism about psi, issues of replication, and theories of psi are also discussed.},

To illustrate their argument, they reanalyzed a set of psi experiments published recently in this journal by Bem (2011), maintaining that, contrary to his conclusion, his data do not yield evidence in favor of the psi hypothesis. We argue that they have incorrectly selected an unrealistic prior distribution for their analysis and that a bayesian analysis using a more reasonable distribution yields strong evidence in favor of the psi hypothesis. More generally, we argue that there are advantages to bayesian analyses that merit their increased use in the future. However, as Wagenmakers et al.'s analysis inadvertently revealed, they contain hidden traps that must be better understood before being more widely substituted for the familiar frequentist analyses currently employed by most research psychologists.},

Highly integrated and interactive research teams share a number of features that contribute to their success in developing and sustaining their efforts over time. Through analysis of in-depth interviews with members of highly successful research teams and others who did not meet their goals or ended because of conflicts, we identified key elements that are critical for team success and effectiveness. There is no debate that the scientific goal sits at the center of the collaborative effort. However, supporting features need to be in place to avoid the derailment of the team. Among the most important of these is trust: without trust, the team dynamic runs the risk of deteriorating over time. Other critical factors of which both leaders and participants need to be aware include developing a shared vision, strategically identifying team members and purposefully building the team, promoting disagreement while containing conflict, and setting clear expectations for sharing credit and authorship. Self-awareness and strong communication skills contribute greatly to effective leadership and management strategies of scientific teams. While all successful teams share the characteristic of effectively carrying out these activities, there is no single formula for execution with every leader exemplifying different strengths and weaknesses. Successful scientific collaborations have strong leaders who are self-aware and are mindful of the many elements critical for supporting the science at the center of the effort.},

This imagery can have motor or perceptual content. Three main questions about the process remain under-explored, however. First, are lexical associations with perception or motion sufficient to yield mental simulation, or is the integration of lexical semantics into larger structures, like sentences, necessary? Second, what linguistic elements (e.g., verbs, nouns, etc.) trigger mental simulations? Third, how detailed are the visual simulations that are performed? A series of behavioral experiments address these questions, using a visual object categorization task to investigate whether up- or down-related language selectively interferes with visual processing in the same part of the visual field (following Richardson et al., 2003). The results demonstrate that either subject nouns or main verbs can trigger visual imagery, but only when used in literal sentences about real space\textemdash metaphorical language does not yield significant effects\textemdash which implies that it is the comprehension of the sentence as a whole and not simply lexical associations that yields imagery effects. These studies also show that the evoked imagery contains detail as to the part of the visual field where the described scene would take place.},

  abstract = {The bioequivalence problem is of practical importance because the approval of most generic drugs in the United States and the European Community (EC) requires the establishment of bioequivalence between the brand-name drug and the proposed generic version. The problem is theoretically interesting because it has been recognized as one for which the desired inference, instead of the usual significant difference, is practical equivalence. The concept of intersection-union tests will be shown to clarify, simplify and unify bioequivalence testing. A test more powerful than the one currently specified by the FDA and EC guidelines will be derived. The claim that the bioequivalence problem defined in terms of the ratio of parameters is more difficult than the problem defined in terms of the difference of parameters will be refuted. The misconception that size-\$\textbackslash alpha\$ bioequivalence tests generally correspond to 100(1 - 2\$\textbackslash alpha\$)\% confidence sets will be shown to lead to incorrect statistical practices, and should be abandoned. Techniques for constructing 100(1-\$\textbackslash alpha\$)\% confidence sets that correspond to size-\$\textbackslash alpha\$ bioequivalence tests will be described. Finally, multiparameter bioequivalence problems will be discussed.},

  abstract = {High school students in 19 teaching dyads were measured for their degree of interpersonal coordination and rapport. Two types of movement coordination were identified and rated by a group of untrained judges: the degree of perceived movement synchrony, and the extent of behavior matching. Ratings of movement synchrony in true interactions were significantly greater than similar ratings in pseudo interaction control clips (i.e., video clips that appeared to be of the teacher and student interacting but were, in fact, a combination of video clips of each interactant recorded from different points within their interaction). Self-ratings collected from interactants indicated a strong relationship between participants' rapport and the degree of movement synchrony perceived by raters. This relationship remained even after observer ratings of each interactant's friendliness, a possibie confound, were partialled out. This result provided empirical evidence for the hypothesized relationship between rapport and interpersonal coordination (TickleDegnen \& Rosenthal, 1987). Ratings of behavior matching did not differ significantly between the true interactions and pseudo interaction control clips. Behavior matching failed to correlate significantly with dyadic rapport. It was, however, significantly predictive of self-reported anxiety.},

The quality (risk of bias) of the primary studies should be critically appraised. Particularly the role of publication and language bias should be acknowledged and addressed by the review, whenever possible. Structured reporting of the results with quantitative pooling of the data must be attempted, whenever appropriate. The review should include interpretation of the data, including implications for clinical practice and further research.

  abstract = {Fallibility in science cuts both ways: it poses dilemmas for the scientist who discovers errors in their own work, and for those who discover errors in the work of others. The ethical response to finding errors in one's own work is clear: they should be claimed and corrected as rapidly as possible. Yet people are often reluctant to 'do the right thing' because of a perception this could lead to reputational damage. I argue that the best defence against such outcomes is adoption of open science practices, which help avoid errors and also leads to recognition that mistakes are part of normal science. Indeed, a reputation for scientific integrity can be enhanced by admitting to errors. The second part of the paper focuses on situations where errors are discovered in the work of others; in the case of honest errors, action must be taken to put things right, but this should be done in a collegial way that offers the researcher the opportunity to deal with the problem themselves. Difficulties arise if those who commit errors are unresponsive or reluctant to make changes, when there is disagreement about whether a dataset or analysis is problematic, or where deliberate manipulation of findings or outright fraud is suspected. I offer some guidelines about how to approach such cases. My key message is that for science to progress, we have to accept the inevitability of error. In the long run, scientists will not be judged on whether or not they make mistakes, but on how they respond when those mistakes are detected.},

What remains elusive to many researchers and is frequently misunderstood is that predictions involving interactions dramatically affect the calculation of statistical power. Using recent papers published in Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin (PSPB), we illustrate the pitfalls of improper power estimations in studies where attenuated interactions are predicted. Our investigation shows why even a programmatic series of six studies employing 2 \texttimes{} 2 designs, with samples exceeding N = 500, can be woefully underpowered to detect genuine effects. We also highlight the importance of accounting for error-prone measures when estimating effect sizes and calculating power, explaining why even positive results can mislead when power is low. We then provide five guidelines for researchers to avoid these pitfalls, including cautioning against the heuristic that a series of underpowered studies approximates the credibility of one well-powered study.},

When we use a test of significance to compare two groups we usually start with the null hypothesis that there is no difference between the populations from which the data come. If this hypothesis is not true the alternative hypothesis must be true - that there is a difference. Since the null hypothesis specifies no direction for the difference nor does the alternative hypothesis, and so we have a two sided test. In a one sided test the alternative hypothesis does specify a direction - for example, that an active treatment is better than a placebo. This is sometimes justified by saying that we are not interested in the possibility that the active treatment is worse than no treatment. This possibility is still part of \ldots},

The answer, perhaps surprisingly, is not often. As expected, the probability of observing misleading evidence does increase with each additional examination. However, the amount by which this probability increases converges to zero as the sample size grows. As a result, the probability of observing misleading evidence remains bounded\textemdash and therefore controllable\textemdash even with an infinite number of looks at the data. Here we use boundary crossing results to detail how often misleading likelihood ratios arise in sequential designs. We find that the probability of observing a misleading likelihood ratio is often much less than its universal bound. Additionally, we find that in the presence of fixed-dimensional nuisance parameters, profile likelihoods are to be preferred over estimated likelihoods which result from replacing the nuisance parameters by their global maximum likelihood estimates.},

The second-generation p-value (SGPV) is an extension that formally accounts for scientific relevance by using a composite null hypothesis that captures null and scientifically trivial effects. Because the majority of spurious findings are small effects that are technically nonnull but practically indistinguishable from the null, the second-generation approach greatly reduces the likelihood of a false discovery. SGPVs promote transparency, rigor and reproducibility of scientific results by a priori identifying which candidate hypotheses are practically meaningful and by providing a more reliable statistical summary of when the data are compatible with the candidate hypotheses or null hypotheses, or when the data are inconclusive. We illustrate the importance of these advances using a dataset of 247,000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms, i.e., genetic markers that are potentially associated with prostate cancer.},

Under this paradigm, re-examination of accumulating evidence is encouraged because (i) the likelihood ratio, unlike a p-value, is una ected by the number of examinations and (ii) the probability of observing strong misleading evidence is naturally low, even for study designs that re-examine the data with each new observation. Further, the controllable probabilities of observing misleading and weak evidence provide assurance that the study design is reliable without a ecting the strength of statistical evidence in the data. This paper illustrates the ideas and methods associated with using likelihood ratios to measure statistical evidence. It contains a comprehensive introduction to the evidential paradigm, including an overview of how to quantify the probability of observing misleading evidence for various study designs. The University Group Diabetes Program (UGDP), a classic and still controversial multi-centred clinical trial, is used as an illustrative example.

Here we introduce a novel extension of the p-value\textemdash a second-generation p-value (p{$\delta$})\textendash that formally accounts for scientific relevance and leverages this natural Type I Error control. The approach relies on a pre-specified interval null hypothesis that represents the collection of effect sizes that are scientifically uninteresting or are practically null. The second-generation p-value is the proportion of data-supported hypotheses that are also null hypotheses. As such, second-generation p-values indicate when the data are compatible with null hypotheses (p{$\delta$} = 1), or with alternative hypotheses (p{$\delta$} = 0), or when the data are inconclusive (0 {$<$} p{$\delta$} {$<$} 1). Moreover, second-generation p-values provide a proper scientific adjustment for multiple comparisons and reduce false discovery rates. This is an advance for environments rich in data, where traditional p-value adjustments are needlessly punitive.

In this paper, I explore common reasons that code developed for one research project cannot be successfully executed or extended by subsequent researchers. I review current approaches to these issues, including virtual machines and workflow systems, and their limitations. I then examine how the popular emerging technology Docker combines several areas from systems research - such as operating system virtualization, cross-platform portability, modular re-usable elements, versioning, and a 'DevOps' philosophy, to address these challenges. I illustrate this with several examples of Docker use with a focus on the R statistical environment.},

In contrast to other statistical estimates, however, their sample-to-sample variability is usually not considered or estimated, and therefore not fully appreciated. Via a systematic study of log-scale p-value standard errors, bootstrap prediction bounds, and reproducibility probabilities for future replicate p-values, we show that p-values exhibit surprisingly large variability in typical data situations. In addition to providing context to discussions about the failure of statistical results to replicate, our findings shed light on the relative value of exact p-values vis-a-vis approximate p-values, and indicate that the use of *, **, and *** to denote levels 0.05, 0.01, and 0.001 of statistical significance in subject-matter journals is about the right level of precision for reporting p-values when judged by widely accepted rules for rounding statistical estimates.},

  abstract = {To draw causal conclusions about the efficacy of a psychological intervention, researchers must compare the treatment condition with a control group that accounts for improvements caused by factors other than the treatment. Using an active control helps to control for the possibility that improvement by the experimental group resulted from a placebo effect. Although active control groups are superior to ``no-contact'' controls, only when the active control group has the same expectation of improvement as the experimental group can we attribute differential improvements to the potency of the treatment. Despite the need to match expectations between treatment and control groups, almost no psychological interventions do so. This failure to control for expectations is not a minor omission\textemdash it is a fundamental design flaw that potentially undermines any causal inference. We illustrate these principles with a detailed example from the video-game-training literature showing how the use of an active control group does not eliminate expectation differences. The problem permeates other interventions as well, including those targeting mental health, cognition, and educational achievement. Fortunately, measuring expectations and adopting alternative experimental designs makes it possible to control for placebo effects, thereby increasing confidence in the causal efficacy of psychological interventions.},

In this study, using the data of two comprehensive evaluation studies on the CPR process at Angewandte Chemie\textemdash International Edition and the PPR process at Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics, we examined the language characteristics in comments that were written by invited reviewers in CPR and by invited reviewers and interested members of the scientific community in PPR. We used Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC), a text analysis software program that counts words in meaningful categories (e.g., positive or negative emotions) using a standardized dictionary. We examined 599 comments from the reviews of 229 manuscripts. The results show that the comments in PPR are much longer than the comments in CPR. This is an indication that PPR reviewing has more of an improvement function and CPR reviewing has more of a selection function. The results also show that CPR is not, as might be expected, more susceptible to the expression of negative emotions than PPR is. On the contrary, positive emotion words are used statistically significantly more frequently in CPR than in PPR.},

For this purpose, a content analysis was performed of comments which led to the rejection of the manuscripts at AC-IE. For the content analysis, a classification scheme with thematic areas developed by Bornmann et al. (2008) was used. As the results of the analysis demonstrate, a large number of negative comments from referees in the areas ``Relevance of contribution'' and ``Design/Conception'' are clear signs that a manuscript rejected at AC-IE will not be published later in a high-impact journal. The number of negative statements in the areas ``Writing/Presentation,'' ``Discussion of results,'' ``Method/Statistics,'' and ``Reference to the literature and documentation,'' on the other hand, had no statistically significant influence on the probability that a rejected manuscript would later be published in a low- or high-impact journal.

In particular, the paper asks whether the abstract domain of time gets its relational structure from the more concrete domain of space. Relational similarities between space and time are outlined along with several explanations of how these similarities may have arisen. Three experiments designed to distinguish between these explanations are described. The results indicate that (1) the domains of space and time do share conceptual structure, (2) spatial relational information is just as useful for thinking about time as temporal information, and (3) with frequent use, mappings between space and time come to be stored in the domain of time and so thinking about time does not necessarily require access to spatial schemas. These \textregistered ndings provide some of the \textregistered rst empirical evidence for Metaphoric Structuring. It appears that abstract domains such as time are indeed shaped by metaphorical mappings from more concrete and experiential domains such as space. q 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

This congruence effect is known as the Action?Sentence Compatibility Effect (ACE). This study reports 4 experiments that extend our understanding of the ACE by exploring how the time at which one prepares the motor response required for the sensibility judgment affects the magnitude of the ACE. Results show that the ACE arises only when participants have the opportunity to plan their motor response while they are processing the sentence.},

  abstract = {This paper aims to improve theory formation in psychology by developing a practical methodology for constructing explanatory theories: Theory Construction Methodology (TCM). TCM is a sequence of five steps. First, the theorist identifies empirical phenomena to become the target of explanation. Second, the theorist constructs a proto-theory: a set of theoretical principles that potentially explain these phenomena. Third, the proto-theory is used to construct a formal model: a set of model equations or simulation models that encode the explanatory principles. Fourth, the theorist investigates this model's explanatory adequacy. This is done by formalizing the empirical phenomena in terms of the model, and assessing whether the model indeed reproduces them. Fifth, the theorist studies the overall adequacy of the theory by evaluating whether phenomena are indeed reproduced faithfully, whether explanatory principles are parsimonious and substantively plausible, and whether the theory implies new predictions to promote further research. We illustrate TCM with an example taken from the intelligence literature (the mutualism model of intelligence), discuss the place of TCM in the larger scheme of scientific research, and propose an outline for a university curriculum that can systematically educate psychologists in the process of theory formation.},

  abstract = {Background
Non-inferiority trials are performed when the main therapeutic effect of the new therapy is expected to be not unacceptably worse than that of the standard therapy, and the new therapy is expected to have advantages over the standard therapy in costs or other (health) consequences. These advantages however are not included in the classic frequentist approach of sample size calculation for non-inferiority trials. In contrast, the decision theory approach of sample size calculation does include these factors. The objective of this study is to compare the conceptual and practical aspects of the frequentist approach and decision theory approach of sample size calculation for non-inferiority trials, thereby demonstrating that the decision theory approach is more appropriate for sample size calculation of non-inferiority trials.

Methods
The frequentist approach and decision theory approach of sample size calculation for non-inferiority trials are compared and applied to a case of a non-inferiority trial on individually tailored duration of elastic compression stocking therapy compared to two years elastic compression stocking therapy for the prevention of post thrombotic syndrome after deep vein thrombosis.

Results
The two approaches differ substantially in conceptual background, analytical approach, and input requirements. The sample size calculated according to the frequentist approach yielded 788 patients, using a power of 80\% and a one-sided significance level of 5\%. The decision theory approach indicated that the optimal sample size was 500 patients, with a net value of \texteuro 92 million.

Conclusions
This study demonstrates and explains the differences between the classic frequentist approach and the decision theory approach of sample size calculation for non-inferiority trials. We argue that the decision theory approach of sample size estimation is most suitable for sample size calculation of non-inferiority trials.},

All children were able to verbally express an emotional response to each color, and 69\% of children's emotional responses were positive (e.g., happiness, excitement). Responses also demonstrated distinct color-emotion associations. Children had positive reactions to bright colors (e.g., pink, blue, red) and negative emotions for dark colors (e.g., brown. black, gray). Children's emotional reactions to bright colors became increasingly positive with age, and girls in particular showed a preference for brighter colors and a dislike for darker colors. Boys were more likely than girls were to have positive emotional a.;;sociations with dark colors. Potential sources for children's color-emotion concepts, such as gender-related and idiosyncratic experiences, are discussed.},

  abstract = {Background:~In the United States, \$50,000 per Quality-Adjusted Life-Year (QALY) is a decision rule that is often used to guide interpretation of cost-effectiveness analyses. However, many investigators have questioned the scientific basis of this rule, and it has not been updated.
        Methods:~We used 2 separate approaches to investigate whether the \$50,000 per QALY rule is consistent with current resource allocation decisions. To infer a lower bound for the decision rule, we estimated the incremental cost-effectiveness of recent (2003) versus pre-``modern era'' (1950) medical care in the United States. To infer an upper bound for the decision rule, we estimated the incremental cost-effectiveness of unsubsidized health insurance versus self-pay for nonelderly adults (ages 21\textendash 64) without health insurance. We discounted both costs and benefits, following recommendations of the Panel on Cost-Effectiveness in Health and Medicine.
        Results:~Our base case analyses suggest that plausible lower and upper bounds for a cost-effectiveness decision rule are \$183,000 per life-year and \$264,000 per life-year, respectively. Our sensitivity analyses widen the plausible range (between \$95,000 per life-year saved and \$264,000 per life-year saved when we considered only health care's impact on quantity of life, and between \$109,000 per QALY saved and \$297,000 per QALY saved when we considered health care's impact on quality as well as quantity of life) but it remained substantially higher than \$50,000 per QALY.
        Conclusions:~It is very unlikely that \$50,000 per QALY is consistent with societal preferences in the United States.},

The median CI width for d was greater than 1 in both surveys. Hence, CI widths were, as Cohen (1994) speculated, embarrassingly large. Additional exploratory analyses revealed that CI widths varied across psychological research areas and that CI widths were not discernably decreasing over time. The theoretical implications of these findings are discussed along with ways of reducing the CI widths and thus improving precision of effect size estimation.},

that women in such legislatures may actually be encouraged to develop
legislative agendas that are distinct from those of their male colleagues,
and that they may be as successful as their male counterparts. Analyzing
data from three state legislatures in four years, I find that even in
extremely skewed state legislatures, women are generally more active than
men in sponsoring legislation that focuses on women's interests;
indeed, in two of the three states, gender differences narrow as the
legislature becomes more gender balanced. Second, I find that women are
generally as successful as men in passing the legislation that they
sponsor, and that in very homogeneous settings, they are sometimes more
successful than men. Moreover, little evidence exists that they are less
likely to be appointed to leadership positions. Finally, I find that
increasing gender diversity within a legislature is accompanied by a
greater overall focus on women's issues. I conclude that a
``critical mass'' is not necessary for substantive
representation on the part of individual female state legislators, but
that increased diversity may indeed bring about changes in policy outputs
that reflect the interests of women.},

Combined with the low power of most current work, this often leads to the use of misleading criteria about whether an effect has replicated. Rosenthal (1990) suggested more appropriate criteria, here labeled the continuously cumulating meta-analytic (CCMA) approach. For example, a CCMA analysis on a replication attempt that does not reach significance might nonetheless provide more, not less, evidence that the effect is real. Alternatively, measures of heterogeneity might show that two studies that differ in whether they are significant might have only trivially different effect sizes. We present a nontechnical introduction to the CCMA framework (referencing relevant software), and then explain how it can be used to address aspects of replicability or more generally to assess quantitative evidence from numerous studies. We then present some examples and simulation results using the CCMA approach that show how the combination of evidence can yield improved results over the consideration of single studies.},

The double-anchoring theory I propose in this paper, as a development of the anchoring theory of Gilchrist et al. (1999), assumes that any given region (a) belongs to one or more frameworks, created by Gestalt grouping principles, and (b) is independently anchored, within each framework, to both the highest luminance and the surround luminance. The region's final lightness is a weighted average of the values computed, relative to both anchors, in all frameworks. The new model not only accounts for all lightness illusions that are qualitatively explained by the anchoring theory, but also for a number of additional effects; and it does so quantitatively, with the support of mathematical simulations.},

  abstract = {"Adopting a unifying theme based on maximum statistics, Multiple Comparisons Using R describes the common underlying theory of multiple comparison procedures through numerous examples. After giving examples of multiplicity problems, the book covers general concepts and basic multiple comparisons procedures, including the Bonferroni method and Simes' test. It then shows how to perform parametric multiple comparisons in standard linear models and general parametric models. It also introduces the multcomp package in R, which offers a convenient interface to perform multiple comparisons in a general context. Following this theoretical framework, the book explores applications involving the Dunnett test, Tukey's all pairwise comparisons, and general multiple contrast tests for standard regression models, mixed-effects models, and parametric survival models. The last chapter reviews other multiple comparison procedures, such as resampling-based procedures, methods for group sequential or adaptive designs, and the combination of multiple comparison procedures with modeling techniques. Controlling multiplicity in experiments ensures better decision making and safeguards against false claims. A self-contained introduction to multiple comparison procedures, this book offers strategies for constructing the procedures and illustrates the framework for multiple hypotheses testing in general parametric models. It is suitable for readers with R experience but limited knowledge of multiple comparison procedures and vice versa."--Publisher's description},

The goal of probability models is to quantify uncertainty in an observable Y given assumptions or observations X. That and nothing more. This, and only this, form of model result should be presented. Regression is of paramount importance. The horrors to thought and clear reasoning committed in its name are legion. Scarcely any user of regression knows its limitations, mainly because of the fallacies of hypothesis testing and the over-certainty of parameter-based reporting. The Deadly Sin of Reification is detailed. The map is not the territory, though this fictional land is unfortunately where many choose to live. When the data do not match a theory, it is often the data that are suspected, not the theory. Models should never take the place of actual data, though they often do, particularly in time series. Risk is nearly always exaggerated. The fallacious belief that we can quantify the unquantifiable is responsible for scientism. ``Smoothed'' data is often given pride of place over actual observations. Over-certainty rampages across the land and leads to irreproducible results.},

  abstract = {Background
The peer review process is a cornerstone of biomedical research. We aimed to evaluate the impact of interventions to improve the quality of peer review for biomedical publications.

Methods
We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE (PubMed), Embase, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and WHO ICTRP databases, for all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the impact of interventions to improve the quality of peer review for biomedical publications. 

Results
We selected 22 reports of randomized controlled trials, for 25 comparisons evaluating training interventions (n\,=\,5), the addition of a statistical peer reviewer (n\,=\,2), use of a checklist (n\,=\,2), open peer review (i.e., peer reviewers informed that their identity would be revealed; n\,=\,7), blinded peer review (i.e., peer reviewers blinded to author names and affiliation; n\,=\,6) and other interventions to increase the speed of the peer review process (n\,=\,3). Results from only seven RCTs were published since 2004. As compared with the standard peer review process, training did not improve the quality of the peer review report and use of a checklist did not improve the quality of the final manuscript. Adding a statistical peer review improved the quality of the final manuscript (standardized mean difference (SMD), 0.58; 95~\% CI, 0.19 to 0.98). Open peer review improved the quality of the peer review report (SMD, 0.14; 95~\% CI, 0.05 to 0.24), did not affect the time peer reviewers spent on the peer review (mean difference, 0.18; 95~\% CI, \textendash 0.06 to 0.43), and decreased the rate of rejection (odds ratio, 0.56; 95~\% CI, 0.33 to 0.94). Blinded peer review did not affect the quality of the peer review report or rejection rate. Interventions to increase the speed of the peer review process were too heterogeneous to allow for pooling the results.

Conclusion
Despite the essential role of peer review, only a few interventions have been assessed in randomized controlled trials. Evidence-based peer review needs to be developed in biomedical journals.

Does a fact provide better evidence for a theory if it was not known before being deduced from the theory? These questions can be answered by analyzing historical cases. Einstein's successful prediction of gravitational light bending from his general theory of relativity has been presented as an important example of how "real" science works (in contrast to alleged pseudosciences like psychoanalysis). But, while this success gained favorable publicity for the theory, most scientists did not give it any more weight than the deduction of the advance of Mercury's perihelion (a phenomenon known for several decades). The fact that scientists often use the word "prediction" to describe the deduction of such previously known facts suggests that novelty may be of little importance in evaluating theories. It may even detract from the evidential value of a fact, until it is clear that competing theories cannot account for the new fact.},

  abstract = {The neural bases of imitation learning are virtually unknown. In the present study, we addressed this issue using an event-related fMRI paradigm. Musically naive participants were scanned during four events: (1) observation of guitar chords played by a guitarist, (2) a pause following model observation, (3) execution of the observed chords, and (4) rest. The results showed that the basic circuit underlying imitation learning consists of the inferior parietal lobule and the posterior part of the inferior frontal gyrus plus the adjacent premotor cortex (mirror neuron circuit). This circuit, known to be involved in action understanding, starts to be active during the observation of the guitar chords. During pause, the middle frontal gyrus (area 46) plus structures involved in motor preparation (dorsal premotor cortex, superior parietal lobule, rostral mesial areas) also become active. Given the functional properties of area 46, a model of imitation learning is proposed based on interactions between this area and the mirror neuron system.},

  abstract = {Background: This study was designed to explore whether or not children systematically use particular colours when completing drawings of affectively characterised topics. Method: Three hundred and thirty 4\textendash 11-year-old children were subdivided into three conditions, colouring in a drawing of a man, a dog, or a tree, respectively. The children completed two test sessions in counterbalanced order. In one session, children rated and ranked ten colours in order of preference. In the other session, children completed three colouring tasks in which they had to colour in three identical figures but which had been given different affective characterisations: a neutrally characterised figure, a figure characterised as nasty, and a figure characterised as nice. Results: It was found that, in all age groups and for all topics, the children used their more preferred colours for the nice figures, their least preferred colours for the nasty figures, and colours rated intermediately for the neutral figures. It was also found that, in all age groups and for all topics, black tended to be the most frequently chosen colour for colouring in the drawings of the negatively characterised figures. By contrast, primary colours were predominantly selected for the neutral figure, while a wide range of mainly primary and secondary colours were chosen for colouring in the nice figure. Conclusions: These results suggest that children are able to alter systematically their use of colour during picture completion tasks in response to differential affective topic characterisations, and that even very young children are able to use colours symbolically.},

  abstract = {Human ovulation is not advertised, as it is in several primate species, by conspicuous sexual swellings. However, there is increasing evidence that the attractiveness of women's body odor, voice, and facial appearance peak during the fertile phase of their ovulatory cycle. Cycle effects on facial attractiveness may be underpinned by changes in facial skin color, but it is not clear if skin color varies cyclically in humans or if any changes are detectable. To test these questions we photographed women daily for at least one cycle. Changes in facial skin redness and luminance were then quantified by mapping the digital images to human long, medium, and shortwave visual receptors. We find cyclic variation in skin redness, but not luminance. Redness decreases rapidly after menstrual onset, increases in the days before ovulation, and remains high through the luteal phase. However, we also show that this variation is unlikely to be detectable by the human visual system. We conclude that changes in skin color are not responsible for the effects of the ovulatory cycle on women's attractiveness.},

Such evaluation cannot be achieved with studies of real data alone. Designing high-quality simulations that reflect the complex situations seen in practice, such as in prognostic factors studies, is not a simple process. Unfortunately, very few published simulation studies provide sufficient details to allow readers to understand fully all the processes required to design a simulation study. When planning a simulation study, it is recommended that a detailed protocol be produced, giving full details of how the study will be performed, analysed and reported. This paper details the important considerations necessary when designing any simulation study, including defining specific objectives of the study, determining the procedures for generating the data sets and the number of simulations to perform. A checklist highlighting the important considerations when designing a simulation study is provided.

This research tackles these important questions by means of an in-depth theoretical-methodological analysis. The study contributes fourfold to organizational research methods: First, it develops a more accurate and explicit conceptualization of BC. Second, it widens the understanding of how BC can be explored by suggesting and juxtaposing new tools and approaches. It also illustrates BC-exploring processes, drawing on two empirical case examples. Third, it analyzes the reasons for exploring BC, concluding that BC exploration fosters theory development, strengthens research validity, and mitigates the research-practice gap. Fourth, it synthesizes the analyses into 12 tentative suggestions for how scholars should subsequently approach the issues surrounding BC. The authors hope that the study contributes to consensus shifting with respect to BC and draws more attention to BC.},

  abstract = {Background
The Beck Depression Inventory, 2nd edition (BDI-II) is widely used in research on depression. However, the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) is unknown. MCID can be estimated in several ways. Here we take a patient-centred approach, anchoring the change on the BDI-II to the patient's global report of improvement.

Method
 We used data collected (n = 1039) from three randomized controlled trials for the management of depression. Improvement on a `global rating of change' question was compared with changes in BDI-II scores using general linear modelling to explore baseline dependency, assessing whether MCID is best measured in absolute terms (i.e. difference) or as percent reduction in scores from baseline (i.e. ratio), and receiver operator characteristics (ROC) to estimate MCID according to the optimal threshold above which individuals report feeling `better'.

Results
Improvement in BDI-II scores associated with reporting feeling `better' depended on initial depression severity, and statistical modelling indicated that MCID is best measured on a ratio scale as a percentage reduction of score. We estimated a MCID of a 17.5\% reduction in scores from baseline from ROC analyses. The corresponding estimate for individuals with longer duration depression who had not responded to antidepressants was higher at 32\%.

Conclusions
MCID on the BDI-II is dependent on baseline severity, is best measured on a ratio scale, and the MCID for treatment-resistant depression is larger than that for more typical depression. This has important implications for clinical trials and practice.},

This APA Task Force on Media Violence examined the existing literature, including the meta-analyses in the field, since the last APA report on media violence in 2005. Because the most recent meta-analyses were published in 2010 and reflected work through 2009, the task force conducted a search of the published studies from 2009-2013. These recently published articles were scored and assessed by a systematic evidentiary review, followed by a meta-analysis of the high utility studies, as documented in the evidentiary review. Consistent with the literature that we reviewed, we found that violent video game exposure was associated with: an increased composite aggression score; increased aggressive behavior; increased aggressive cognitions; increased aggressive affect, increased desensitization, and decreased empathy; and increased physiological arousal. The size of the effects was similar to that in prior meta-analyses, suggesting a stable result. Our task force concluded that violent video game use is a risk factor for adverse outcomes, but found insufficient studies to examine any potential link between violent video game use and delinquency or criminal behavior. Our technical report is the basis of this article. (PsycINFO Database Record},

Experimental economists have joined the reproducibility discussion by replicating selected published experiments from two top-tier journals in economics. Camerer et al. found that two-thirds of the 18 studies examined yielded replicable estimates of effect size and direction. This proportion is somewhat lower than unaffiliated experts were willing to bet in an associated prediction market, but roughly in line with expectations from sample sizes and P values.
Science, this issue p. 1433
The replicability of some scientific findings has recently been called into question. To contribute data about replicability in economics, we replicated 18 studies published in the American Economic Review and the Quarterly Journal of Economics between 2011 and 2014. All of these replications followed predefined analysis plans that were made publicly available beforehand, and they all have a statistical power of at least 90\% to detect the original effect size at the 5\% significance level. We found a significant effect in the same direction as in the original study for 11 replications (61\%); on average, the replicated effect size is 66\% of the original. The replicability rate varies between 67\% and 78\% for four additional replicability indicators, including a prediction market measure of peer beliefs.
By several metrics, economics experiments do replicate, although not as often as predicted.

A simulation study is conducted to examine the Type I error rates and statistical power of the tests, and a comparison is made with an alternative Bayesian testing approach.

While pros and cons are vigorously debated, there has been little to no modeling of how adopting these measures might affect what type of science is published. In this paper, we develop a novel optimality model that, given current incentives to publish, predicts a researcher's most rational use of resources in terms of the number of studies to undertake, the statistical power to devote to each study, and the desirable pre-study odds to pursue. We then develop a methodology that allows one to estimate the reliability of published research by considering a distribution of preferred research strategies. Using this approach, we investigate the merits of adopting measures of `greater statistical stringency' with the goal of informing the ongoing debate.},

We conducted a structured review of the medical literature to examine C/B ratios found in ROC curve analysis. Only two studies were found in which a C/B ratio was explicitly calculated; in another 11 studies, a C/B ratio was based on a so-called holistic estimate, an all-encompassing educated estimate of the relative costs and benefits relevant to the clinical situation. The C/B ratios ranged from 0.0025 (tuberculosis screening) to 2.7 (teeth restoration for carious lesions). Clinical scenarios that are directly life threatening but curable had C/B ratios of less than 0.05. This analysis led us to construct a table of ordered C/B ratios that may be used by investigators to approximate C/B ratios for other clinical situations in order to establish cutpoints for new diagnostic tests.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

These are hypothesized to repeatedly assemble, generation-to-generation, and to function in the coordination of human behavior. We should expect human mental systems to correlate with core configurations; also, that capabilities specialized for specific configurations should be extended for use in other configurations and recombined for novel behavior and situations, including the development of, and life in, complex modem societies.},

  abstract = {This article presents a comprehensive integration of current experimental evidence and theories about so-called parapsychological (psi) phenomena. Throughout history, people have reported events that seem to violate the common sense view of space and time. Some psychologists have been at the forefront of investigating these phenomena with sophisticated research protocols and theory, while others have devoted much of their careers to criticizing the field. Both stances can be explained by psychologists' expertise on relevant processes such as perception, memory, belief, and conscious and nonconscious processes. This article clarifies the domain of psi, summarizes recent theories from physics and psychology that present psi phenomena as at least plausible, and then provides an overview of recent/updated meta-analyses. The evidence provides cumulative support for the reality of psi, which cannot be readily explained away by the quality of the studies, fraud, selective reporting, experimental or analytical incompetence, or other frequent criticisms. The evidence for psi is comparable to that for established phenomena in psychology and other disciplines, although there is no consensual understanding of them. The article concludes with recommendations for further progress in the field including the use of project and data repositories, conducting multidisciplinary studies with enough power, developing further nonconscious measures of psi and falsifiable theories, analyzing the characteristics of successful sessions and participants, improving the ecological validity of studies, testing how to increase effect sizes, recruiting more researchers at least open to the possibility of psi, and situating psi phenomena within larger domains such as the study of consciousness.},

In some cases, theorists have assumed that these different representational forms involve different cognitive processes or implicate different kinds of mental organization. Additional representational constructs are implied by some models that focus more directly on organizational issues, which are discussed later in this chapter (e.g., associative network, schema and exemplar models). Even without considering such models, it is evident that social information can be re resented in a wide variety of different forms. Alth much remains to be learned about the ways in whi these different forms are generated, interrelated, and used, theories of social representation increasingly recognize and accommodate this diversity, rather than simply assuming that "people are relentlessly doing the same thing ... more or less all of the time" (Medin, 1988, p. 121).},

The results of this study confirmed our prediction that posing in high-power nonverbal displays (as opposed to low-power nonverbal displays) would cause neuroendocrine and behavioral changes for both male and female participants: High-power posers experienced elevations in testosterone, decreases in cortisol, and increased feelings of power and tolerance for risk; low-power posers exhibited the opposite pattern. In short, posing in displays of power caused advantaged and adaptive psychological, physiological, and behavioral changes, and these findings suggest that embodiment extends beyond mere thinking and feeling, to physiology and subsequent behavioral choices. That a person can, by assuming two simple 1-min poses, embody power and instantly become more powerful has real-world, actionable implications.},

Methodologists have proposed a variety of statistical approaches to correct for such overestimation. However, it is not clear which methods work best for data typically seen in psychology. Here, we present a comprehensive simulation study in which we examined how some of the most promising meta-analytic methods perform on data that might realistically be produced by research in psychology. We simulated several levels of questionable research practices, publication bias, and heterogeneity, and used study sample sizes empirically derived from the literature. Our results clearly indicated that no single meta-analytic method consistently outperformed all the others. Therefore, we recommend that meta-analysts in psychology focus on sensitivity analyses\textemdash that is, report on a variety of methods, consider the conditions under which these methods fail (as indicated by simulation studies such as ours), and then report how conclusions might change depending on which conditions are most plausible. Moreover, given the dependence of meta-analytic methods on untestable assumptions, we strongly recommend that researchers in psychology continue their efforts to improve the primary literature and conduct large-scale, preregistered replications. We provide detailed results and simulation code at https://osf.io/rf3ys and interactive figures at http://www.shinyapps.org/apps/metaExplorer/.},

  abstract = {Meta-analysis represents the promise of cumulative science--that each successive study brings us greater understanding of a given phenomenon. As such, meta-analyses are highly influential and gaining in popularity. However, there are well-known threats to the validity of meta-analytic results, such as processes like publication bias and questionable research practices which can cause researchers to massively overestimate the evidence in support of a claim. There are many statistical methods to correct for such bias, but no single method has been found to be robust in all realistic conditions. Here, I describe a method that merges statistical simulation and deep learning to achieve an unprecedented level of robust meta-analytic estimation in the face of numerous forms of bias and other historically problematic conditions. Furthermore, the resulting estimator, called DeepMA, has the unique property that it can easily evolve: As new conditions for which robustness is needed are identified, DeepMA can be re-trained to maintain high performance. Given the weaknesses that have been identified for meta-analysis, the current consensus is that it should serve as simply another data point, rather than residing at the top of the hierarchy of evidence. The novel approach I describe, however, holds the potential to eliminate these weaknesses, possibly solidifying meta-analysis as the platinum standard in scientific debate.},

Similarity ratings for pairs of words or pictures varied as a function of how far apart stimuli appeared on the computer screen, but the influence of distance on similarity differed depending on the type of judgments participants made. Stimuli presented closer together were rated more similar during `conceptual' judgments of abstract entities or unseen object properties, but less similar during `perceptual' judgments of visual appearance. These contrasting results underscore the importance of testing predictions based on linguistic metaphors experimentally, and suggest that our sense of similarity arises from our ability to combine available perceptual information with stored knowledge of experiential regularities.},

Native Greekspeaking children watched movies of two animals traveling along parallel paths for different distances or durations and judged the spatial and temporal aspects of these events (e.g., Which animal went for a longer distance, or a longer time?). Results showed a reliable cross-dimensional asymmetry. For the same stimuli, spatial information influenced temporal judgments more than temporal information influenced spatial judgments. This pattern was robust to variations in the age of the participants and the type of linguistic framing used to elicit responses. This finding demonstrates a continuity between space-time representations in children and adults, and informs theories of analog magnitude representation.},

In this paper we investigate whether mental representations that result from physical experience underlie people's more abstract mental representations, using the domains of space and time as a testbed. People often talk about time using spatial language (e.g., a long vacation, a short concert). Do people also think about time using spatial representations, even when they are not using language? Results of six psychophysical experiments revealed that people are unable to ignore irrelevant spatial information when making judgments about duration, but not the converse. This pattern, which is predicted by the asymmetry between space and time in linguistic metaphors, was demonstrated here in tasks that do not involve any linguistic stimuli or responses. These findings provide evidence that the metaphorical relationship between space and time observed in language also exists in our more basic representations of distance and duration. Results suggest that our mental representations of things we can never see or touch may be built, in part, out of representations of physical experiences in perception and motor action. \'O 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Instead, we found that these affective influences resulted from the interaction of these actions with a priori differences in stimulus valence. Thus, with negative stimuli, the effect of extension on attitude was more positive than the effect of flexion. Experiment 2 demonstrated that the affect from motivationally compatible or incompatible action can also influence task evaluations. A final experiment, using Chinese ideographs from the original studies, confirmed these findings. Both approach and avoidance actions led to more positive evaluations of the ideographs when the actions were motivationally compatible with the prior valence of the ideographs. The attitudinal impact of approach-avoidance action thus reflects its situated meaning, which depends on the valence of stimuli being approached or avoided.},

Our motivated-preparation account posits that priming a social category readies the individual for adaptive behavioral responses to that category\textemdash responses that take into account the physical environment. We present the first evidence showing that the cognitive responses (Study 1) and the behavioral responses (Studies 2a and 2b) automatically elicited by a social-category prime differ depending on a person's physical surroundings. Specifically, after priming with pictures of Black men (a threatening out-group), participants responded with either aggressive behavior (fight) or distancing behavior (flight), depending on what action was allowed by the situation. For example, when participants were seated in an enclosed booth (no distancing behavior possible) during priming, they showed increased accessibility of fight-related action semantics; however, when seated in an open field (distancing behavior possible), they showed increased accessibility of flight-related action semantics. {$\mkern1mu$}These findings suggest that an understanding of automaticity must consider its situated nature.},

  abstract = {ContextSelective reporting of outcomes within published studies based on the nature or direction of their results has been widely suspected, but direct evidence of such bias is currently limited to case reports.ObjectiveTo study empirically the extent and nature of outcome reporting bias in a cohort of randomized trials.DesignCohort study using protocols and published reports of randomized trials approved by the Scientific-Ethical Committees for Copenhagen and Frederiksberg, Denmark, in 1994-1995. The number and characteristics of reported and unreported trial outcomes were recorded from protocols, journal articles, and a survey of trialists. An outcome was considered incompletely reported if insufficient data were presented in the published articles for meta-analysis. Odds ratios relating the completeness of outcome reporting to statistical significance were calculated for each trial and then pooled to provide an overall estimate of bias. Protocols and published articles were also compared to identify discrepancies in primary outcomes.Main Outcome MeasuresCompleteness of reporting of efficacy and harm outcomes and of statistically significant vs nonsignificant outcomes; consistency between primary outcomes defined in the most recent protocols and those defined in published articles.ResultsOne hundred two trials with 122 published journal articles and 3736 outcomes were identified. Overall, 50\% of efficacy and 65\% of harm outcomes per trial were incompletely reported. Statistically significant outcomes had a higher odds of being fully reported compared with nonsignificant outcomes for both efficacy (pooled odds ratio, 2.4; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.4-4.0) and harm (pooled odds ratio, 4.7; 95\% CI, 1.8-12.0) data. In comparing published articles with protocols, 62\% of trials had at least 1 primary outcome that was changed, introduced, or omitted. Eighty-six percent of survey responders (42/49) denied the existence of unreported outcomes despite clear evidence to the contrary.ConclusionsThe reporting of trial outcomes is not only frequently incomplete but also biased and inconsistent with protocols. Published articles, as well as reviews that incorporate them, may therefore be unreliable and overestimate the benefits of an intervention. To ensure transparency, planned trials should be registered and protocols should be made publicly available prior to trial completion.},

  abstract = {Bioequivalence between two treatments or two drugs is often assessed by comparing the two proportions (success rate or eradication rate) of binomial outcomes when the conventional pharmacokinetic parameters are inadequate for the assessment. Setting the equivalence limits can be based on one of the three measures: difference, ratio, or odds ratio between the two binomial probabilities. This paper reviews the existing asymptotic test statistics for comparing two independent binomial probabilities in terms of the three measures in the context of equivalence or noninferiority testing. The actual type I error and power of the asymptotic tests are evaluated by enumerating the exact probabilities in the rejection region. The results show that to establish an equivalence between two treatments with an equivalence limit of 20\% in difference, a sample size of at least 50 per treatment is needed. When the sample size is sufficient, the actual type I error rate is close to the nominal level (slightly above the nominal level in several cases) for a test in terms of difference for equivalence limits, and it tends to exceed the nominal level for tests in terms of ratio or odds ratio.},

Participants were faster at comparing occupations and numbers that were semantically farther apart relative to those more closely related. In Study 2, we examined the semantic distance effect for a social status category, for which participants have as much knowledge of, as with numbers. We asked 15 US Navy Midshipmen to compare the social status associated with different ranks in the Navy as well as compare number magnitudes. Participants were fastest when comparing ranks far in status relative to ranks close in status. These findings reveal that humans have mental representations of social status that share properties with that of number.},

One probable reason for this overuse of two-tailed testing is the seemingly valid beliefs that two-tailed testing is more conservative and safer than one-tailed testing. However, the authors examine the legitimacy of this notion and find it to be flawed. A second and more fundamental cause of the current problem is the pervasive oversight in making a clear distinction between the research hypothesis and the statistical hypothesis. Based upon the explicated, sound relationship between the research and statistical hypotheses, the authors propose a new scheme of hypothesis classification to facilitate and clarify the proper use of statistical hypothesis testing in empirical research.},

The rationale of theory-corroboration experimentation requires nothing more than a binary decision about the relation between two variables. This binary decision supplies the minor premise for the syllogism implicated when a theory is being tested. Some metatheoretical considerations reveal that the magnitude of the effect-size estimate is not a satisfactory alternative to the significance test.

Paradoxically, low statistical power also increases the likelihood that a statistically significant finding is actually falsely positive (for a given p-value). Hence, ethical concerns regarding studies with low statistical power should include the increased risk of type I error in such studies reporting statistically significant effects. This paper illustrates the effect of low statistical power by comparing hypothesis testing with diagnostic test evaluation using concepts familiar to clinicians, such as positive and negative predicative values. We also note that, where there is a high probability that the null hypothesis is true, statistically significant findings are even more likely to be falsely positive.},

  abstract = {There is increased concern about poor scientific practices arising from an excessive focus on P-values. Two particularly worrisome practices are selective reporting of significant results and `P-hacking'. The latter is the manipulation of data collection, usage, or analyses to obtain statistically significant outcomes. Here, we introduce the novel, to our knowledge, concepts of selective reporting of nonsignificant results and `reverse P-hacking' whereby researchers ensure that tests produce a nonsignificant result. We test whether these practices occur in experiments in which researchers randomly assign subjects to treatment and control groups to minimise differences in confounding variables that might affect the focal outcome. By chance alone, 5\% of tests for a group difference in confounding variables should yield a significant result (P {$<$} 0.05). If researchers less often report significant findings and/or reverse P-hack to avoid significant outcomes that undermine the ethos that experimental and control groups only differ with respect to actively manipulated variables, we expect significant results from tests for group differences to be under-represented in the literature. We surveyed the behavioural ecology literature and found significantly more nonsignificant P-values reported for tests of group differences in potentially confounding variables than the expected 95\% (P = 0.005; N = 250 studies). This novel, to our knowledge, publication bias could result from selective reporting of nonsignificant results and/or from reverse P-hacking. We encourage others to test for a bias toward publishing nonsignificant results in the equivalent context in their own research discipline.},

To investigate whether, in psychology, preregistration lives up to that potential, we focused on all articles published in Psychological Science with a preregistered badge between February 2015 and November 2017, and assessed the adherence to their corresponding preregistration plans. We observed deviations from the plan in all studies, and, more importantly, in all but one study, at least one of these deviations was not fully disclosed.

Nevertheless, these same investigators do not hesitate to conclude that their findings are true for language in general. In so doing, it is argued, they are committing the language-as-fixed-effect fallacy, which can lead to serious error. The problem is illustrated for one well-known series of studies in semantic memory. With the appropriate statistics these studies are shown to provide no reliable evidence for most of the main conclusions drawn from them. A review of other experiments in semantic memory shows that many of them are likewise suspect. It is demonstrated how this fallacy can be avoided by doing the right statistics, selecting the appropriate design, and sampling by systematic procedures, or, alternatively, by proceeding according to the so-called method of single cases.},

We suggest that a decision theory framework (Wald, 1950) can provide a tool for researchers to (a) evaluate costs and benefits in order to determine when replication studies are worthwhile, and (b) specify their assumptions in quantifiable terms, facilitating more productive discussions in which the sources of disagreement about the value of replications can be identified.},

We contend that this process is a major source of symmetries in specific systems, whether passive physical systems or active adaptive and/or voluntary/intentional systems, except that active systems have more control over accepting or avoiding rhythmic entrainment. The result of rhythmic entrainment is a simplification of the entrained system, in the sense that the information required to describe it is reduced. Entrainment can be communicated, passing information from one system to another. The paradigm is a group of jazz percussionists agreeing on a complex musical progression. The process of rhythmic entrainment is complementary to that of symmetry breaking, which produces information. The two processes account for much, if not all, of the complexity and organization in the universe. Rhythmic entrainment can be more or less spontaneous, with the completely spontaneous form being uncontrollable. A balance between the two forms can produce a more robust system, requiring less energy to maintain, whether in physical, biological or social systems. We outline some applications in physics, chemistry, biology, measurement and communication, ending with the especially interesting case of social and economic order. First though, we must introduce some basic principles.},

Part of the reason for this is the persistence of the myth that observation of p {$<$} 0.05 is sufficient justification to claim that you have made a discovery. It is hopeless to expect users to change their reliance on p-values unless they are offered an alternative way of judging the reliability of their conclusions. If the alternative method is to have a chance of being adopted widely, it will have to be easy to understand and to calculate. One such proposal is based on calculation of false positive risk(FPR). It is suggested that p-values and confidence intervals should continue to be given, but that they should be supplemented by a single additional number that conveys the strength of the evidence better than the p-value. This number could be the minimum FPR (that calculated on the assumption of a prior probability of 0.5, the largest value that can be assumed in the absence of hard prior data). Alternatively one could specify the prior probability that it would be necessary to believe in order to achieve an FPR of, say, 0.05.},

If, as is often the case, experiments are underpowered, you will be wrong most of the time. This conclusion is demonstrated from several points of view. First, tree diagrams which show the close analogy with the screening test problem. Similar conclusions are drawn by repeated simulations of t-tests. These mimic what is done in real life, which makes the results more persuasive. The simulation method is used also to evaluate the extent to which effect sizes are over-estimated, especially in underpowered experiments. A script is supplied to allow the reader to do simulations themselves, with numbers appropriate for their own work. It is concluded that if you wish to keep your false discovery rate below 5\%, you need to use a three-sigma rule, or to insist on p{$\leq$}0.001. And never use the word `significant'.},

  abstract = {We wish to answer this question: If you observe a `significant' p-value after doing a single unbiased experiment, what is the probability that your result is a false positive? The weak evidence provided by p-values between 0.01 and 0.05 is explored by exact calculations of false positive risks. When you observe p\,=\,0.05, the odds in favour of there being a real effect (given by the likelihood ratio) are about 3\,:\,1. This is far weaker evidence than the odds of 19 to 1 that might, wrongly, be inferred from the p-value. And if you want to limit the false positive risk to 5\%, you would have to assume that you were 87\% sure that there was a real effect before the experiment was done. If you observe p\,=\,0.001 in a well-powered experiment, it gives a likelihood ratio of almost 100\,:\,1 odds on there being a real effect. That would usually be regarded as conclusive. But the false positive risk would still be 8\% if the prior probability of a real effect were only 0.1. And, in this case, if you wanted to achieve a false positive risk of 5\% you would need to observe p\,=\,0.00045. It is recommended that the terms `significant' and `non-significant' should never be used. Rather, p-values should be supplemented by specifying the prior probability that would be needed to produce a specified (e.g. 5\%) false positive risk. It may also be helpful to specify the minimum false positive risk associated with the observed p-value. Despite decades of warnings, many areas of science still insist on labelling a result of p\,{$<$}\,0.05 as `statistically significant'. This practice must contribute to the lack of reproducibility in some areas of science. This is before you get to the many other well-known problems, like multiple comparisons, lack of randomization and p-hacking.

We have investigated the relationship between these variables in the life sciences in the United Kingdom using data from 398 principle investigators (PIs). We show that three measures of productivity, the number of publications, the impact factor of the journals in which papers are published and the number of citations, are all positively correlated to group size, although they all show a pattern of diminishing returns\textemdash doubling group size leads to less than a doubling in productivity. The relationships for the impact factor and the number of citations are extremely weak. Our analyses suggest that an increase in productivity will be achieved by funding more PIs with small research groups, unless the cost of employing post-docs and PhD students is less than 20\% the cost of a PI. We also provide evidence that post-docs are more productive than PhD students both in terms of the number of papers they produce and where those papers are published.},

  abstract = {The assumptions appropriate to the application of analysis of variance to specific examples, and the effects of these assumptions on the resulting interpretations, are today a matter of very active discussion. Formulas for average values of mean squares play a central role in this problem, as do assumptions about interactions. This paper presents formulas for crossed (and, incidentally, for nested and for non-interacting completely randomized) classifications, based on a model of sufficient generality and flexibility that the necessary assumptions concern only the selection of the levels of the factors and not the behavior of what is being experimented upon. (This means, in particular, that the average response is an arbitrary function of the factors.) These formulas are not very complex, and specialize to the classical results for crossed and nested classifications, when appropriate restrictions are made. Complete randomization is only discussed for the elementary case of "no interactions with experimental units" and randomized blocks are not discussed. In discussion and proof, we give most space to the two-way classification with replication, basing our direct proof more closely on the proof independently obtained by Cornfield [17], than on the earlier proof by Tukey [20]. We also treat the three-way classification in detail. Results for the general factorial are also stated and proved. The relation of this paper to other recent work, published and unpublished, is discussed in Section 4 (average values of mean squares) and in Section 11 (various types of linear models).},

The setting is the test of a well-specified null hypothesis (such as the Standard Model of elementary particle physics, possibly with ``nuisance parameters'') versus a composite alternative (such as the Standard Model plus a new force of nature of unknown strength). The ppp value, as well as the ratio of the likelihood under the null hypothesis to the maximized likelihood under the alternative, can strongly disfavor the null hypothesis, while the Bayesian posterior probability for the null hypothesis can be arbitrarily large. The academic statistics literature contains many impassioned comments on this paradox, yet there is no consensus either on its relevance to scientific communication or on its correct resolution. The paradox is quite relevant to frontier research in high energy physics. This paper is an attempt to explain the situation to both physicists and statisticians, in the hope that further progress can be made.},

  abstract = {For scientific theories grounded in empirical data, replicability is a core principle, for at least two reasons. First, unless we accept to have scientific theories rest on the authority of a small number of researchers, empirical studies should be replicable, in the sense that its methods and procedure should be detailed enough for someone else to conduct the same study. Second, for empirical results to provide a solid foundation for scientific theorizing, they should also be replicable, in the sense that most attempts at replicating the original study that produced them would yield similar results. The XPhi Replicability Project is primarily concerned with replicability in the second sense, that is: the replicability of results.  In the past year, several projects have shed doubt on the replicability of key findings in psychology, and most notably social psychology. Because the methods of experimental philosophy have often been close to the ones used in social psychology, it is only natural to wonder to which extent the results experimental philosophers ground their theory are replicable. The aim of the XPhi Replicability Project is precisely to reach a reliable estimate of the replicability of empirical results in experimental philosophy.  To this end, several research teams across the world will replicate around 40 studies in experimental philosophy, some among the most cited, others drawn at random. The results of the project will be published in a special issue of the Review of Philosophy and Psychology dedicated to the topic of replicability in cognitive science.

Participants were instructed to prepare to grasp a bar, oriented either clockwise or counterclockwise, and to grasp it as fast as possible on presentation of a visual stimulus with their right hand. The visual stimuli were pictures of the right hand as seen in a mirror. In Experiment 1, they represented the mirror image of the hand final posture as achieved in grasping the bar oriented either clockwise or counterclockwise. In Experiment 2, in addition to the pictures of Experiment 1, another two pictures, obtained rotating the hands represented in the previous ones of 90\textdegree, were also used. Both experiments showed that the reaction times were faster when there was a similarity between hand position as depicted in the triggering visual stimulus and the grasping hand final position, the fastest responses being those where this similarity was the closest. In addition, Experiment 2 showed that reaction times to not rotated stimuli were faster than reaction times to the rotated stimuli, thus excluding a simple stimulus\textendash response compatibility explanation of the findings. The data are interpreted as behavioral evidence that there is a close link between specific visual stimuli and specific motor actions. A neurophysiological model for this visuo-motor link is presented. \textcopyright{} 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Unfortunately, widespread calls to action have not been effective, in part because of statisticians' tendency to make statistics appear simple. We argue that statistics can meet the needs of science only by empowering scientists to make sound judgments that account for both the nuances of the application and the inherent complexity of fundamental effective statistical practice. In particular, we emphasize a set of statistical principles that scientists can adapt to their ever-expanding scope of problems.},

  abstract = {Researchers often want to demonstrate a lack of interaction between two categorical predictors on an outcome. To justify a lack of interaction, researchers typically accept the null hypothesis of no interaction from a conventional analysis of variance (ANOVA). This method is inappropriate as failure to reject the null hypothesis does not provide statistical evidence to support a lack of interaction. This study proposes a bootstrap-based intersection\textendash union test for negligible interaction that provides coherent decisions between the omnibus test and post hoc interaction contrast tests and is robust to violations of the normality and variance homogeneity assumptions. Further, a multiple comparison strategy for testing interaction contrasts following a non-significant omnibus test is proposed. Our simulation study compared the Type I error control, omnibus power and per-contrast power of the proposed approach to the non-centrality-based negligible interaction test of Cheng and Shao (2007, Statistica Sinica, 17, 1441). For 2~\texttimes ~2 designs, the empirical Type I error rates of the Cheng and Shao test were very close to the nominal {$\alpha$} level when the normality and variance homogeneity assumptions were satisfied; however, only our proposed bootstrapping approach was satisfactory under non-normality and/or variance heterogeneity. In general a~\texttimes ~b designs, although the omnibus Cheng and Shao test, as expected, is the most powerful, it is not robust to assumption violation and results in incoherent omnibus and interaction contrast decisions that are not possible with the intersection\textendash union approach.},

  abstract = {The design of robust new interfaces that process conversational speech is a challenging research direction largely because users' spoken language is so variable, which is especially true of children. The present research explored whether children's response latencies before initiating a conversational turn converge with those heard in the text-to-speech (TTS) of a computer partner. A study was conducted in which twenty-four 7-to-10-year-old children conversed with animated characters that responded with different types of TTS voices during an educational software application. Analyses confirmed that, while interacting with opposite TTS voices, children's average response latencies adapted 18.4\% in the direction of their computer partner's speech. These adaptations were dynamic, bi-directional, and generalized across different types of users and TTS voices. The long-term goal of this research is the predictive modeling of human-computer communication patterns to guide the design of well synchronized, robust, and adaptive conversational interfaces.},

For sample and effect sizes common to experimental psychology, v suggests that OLS produces estimates that are insufficiently accurate for the type of hypotheses being tested. We demonstrate how v can be used to determine sample sizes to obtain minimum acceptable estimation accuracy. Software for calculating v is included as online supplemental material (R core team, 2012).},

In an Information-Choice Questionnaire (ICQ), a representative sample of the Dutch public (n = 995) was provided with all information on attributes of six CCS options, which experts deemed necessary to come to well-considered and well-informed opinions. A traditional questionnaire was used simultaneously (n = 327) to study uninformed evaluations of these technologies. The results showed that the Dutch public is mostly unaware of CCS and has little knowledge about how current energy use causes global warming. Uninformed respondents are still inclined to give their opinion however, which results in unpredictive, easily changeable opinions. ICQ respondents who processed information on attributes of CCS options were likely to base their option evaluations on this information, though not entirely. All in all, the results of the ICQ suggest that, after processing information deemed necessary by experts, Dutch people reluctantly agree with large scale implementation of each of the six CCS options.},

  abstract = {Motivationally relevant stimuli have been shown to receive prioritized processing compared to neutral stimuli at distinct processing stages. This effect has been related to the evolutionary importance of rapidly detecting dangers and potential rewards and has been shown to be modulated by the distance between an organism and a faced stimulus. Similarly, recent studies showed degrees of emotional modulation of autonomic responses and subjective arousal ratings depending on stimulus size. In the present study, affective modulation of pictures presented in different sizes was investigated by measuring event-related potentials during a two-choice categorization task. Results showed significant emotional modulation across all sizes at both earlier and later stages of processing. Moreover, affective modulation of earlier processes was reduced in smaller compared to larger sizes, whereas no changes in affective modulation were observed at later stages.},

  abstract = {Recently, optional stopping has been a subject of debate in the Bayesian psychology community. Rouder (2014) argues that optional stopping is no problem for Bayesians, and even recommends the use of optional stopping in practice, as do Wagenmakers et al. (2012). This article addresses the question whether optional stopping is problematic for Bayesian methods, and specifies under which circumstances and in which sense it is and is not. By slightly varying and extending Rouder's (2014) experiment, we illustrate that, as soon as the parameters of interest are equipped with default or pragmatic priors - which means, in most practical applications of Bayes Factor hypothesis testing - resilience to optional stopping can break down. We distinguish between four types of default priors, each having their own specific issues with optional stopping, ranging from no-problem-at-all (Type 0 priors) to quite severe (Type II and III priors).},

In two experiments, participants saw white words that needed to be classified on the basis of stimulus valence and colored words that were to be classified on the basis of color. On trials where the colored word referred to a positive target concept (e.g., ``flowers,'' ``self ''), performance was superior when the correct response was the response that was also assigned to positive white words. The reverse was true on trials where the colored word represented a negative target concept (e.g., ``insect''). This variant of the IAT is less susceptible to nonassociative effects of task recoding and can be used to assess single and multiple attitudes.},

The results of previous research and of a new study show that IAT effects can, however, also be based on other types of similarity between stimuli. We therefore put forward the hypothesis that the IAT provides a general measure of similarity. Given that similarity is highly dynamic and context-dependent, our view that the IAT measures similarity is compatible with existing evidence showing that IAT effects are highly malleable. We provide further evidence for this in a new study in which the outcome of an IAT depended on whether the perceptual or functional characteristics of the stimuli were made salient.},

In the survey datasets with heavy-tailed variables in particular,rshad lower variability thanrp, and often corresponded more accurately to the population Pearson correlation coefficient (Rp) thanrpdid.

Relatedness can be assessed in several ways, one of which is phenotype matching: the assessment of similarity between others' traits and either one's own traits or those of known relatives. One candidate cue of relatedness in humans is facial resemblance. Here, I report the effects of an experimental manipulation of facial resemblance in a two\textendash person sequential trust game. Subjects were shown faces of ostensible playing partners manipulated to resemble either themselves or an unknown person. Resemblance to the subject's own face raised the incidence of trusting a partner, but had no effect on the incidence of selfish betrayals of the partner's trust. Control subjects playing with identical pictures failed to show such an effect. In a second experiment, resemblance of the playing partner to a familiar (famous) person had no effect on either trusting or betrayals of trust.},

However, despite their importance, test assumptions are rarely explicitly considered in scientific articles. We discuss why the assumptions of normality and homogeneity of variances will often not hold in psychological research. We explain when and why this is problematic, especially for the assumption of homogeneity of variances. Our simulations show that Welch's ANOVA (W-test) controls the Type 1 error rate better than the F-test when the assumption of homogeneity of variance is not met, and loses little robustness compared to the F-test when the assumptions are met.

We focus on the assumptions of normality and equality of variances, and argue that these assumptions are often unrealistic in the field of psychology. We underline the current lack of attention to these assumptions through an analysis of researchers' practices. Through Monte Carlo simulations, we illustrate the consequences of performing the classic parametric F-test for ANOVA when the test assumptions are not met on the Type I error rate and statistical power. Under realistic deviations from the assumption of equal variances, the classic F-test can yield severely biased results and lead to invalid statistical inferences. We examine two common alternatives to the F-test, namely the Welch's ANOVA (W-test) and the Brown-Forsythe test (F*-test). Our simulations show that under a range of realistic scenarios, the W-test is a better alternative and we therefore recommend using the W-test by default when comparing means. We provide a detailed example explaining how to perform the W-test in SPSS and R. We summarize our conclusions in practical recommendations that researchers can use to improve their statistical practices.},

The present study provides evidence that the nature of the visual imagery required by a task determines whether saccades are evoked and in which spatial pattern. In two experiments, subjects solved transitive inference problems with the relational terms left/right and above/ below, while the horizontal and vertical EOG were recorded. Subjects made more horizontal and fewer vertical saccades while solving problems with the left/right terms than while solving identical problems with above/below. The results of silent counting tasks showed that the rate of subvocalization can also influence saccadic rate, especially in the horizontal plane, but cannot explain the eye-movement patterns observed during transitive inference. The results are discussed in terms of a motor theory of voluntary thinking. \textcopyright{} 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {In response to what are seen as fundamental problems in Psychology, a reform movement has emerged that finds inspiration in philosophy of science, the work of Karl Popper in particular. The reformers attempt to put Popper into practice and create a discipline based on the principles of critical rationalism. In this article I describe the concrete sociotechnical practices by which the reformers attempt to realise their ideals, and I argue that they go a long way towards bridging the gap between rules and practice that sociologists of science Mulkay and Gilbert had identified in their study of the role of Popper's philosophy in the work of scientists. Second, I note the considerable resistance that the reformers meet and the disruptive force of their work. I argue that this disruption is productive and raises fundamental questions regarding psychology and its object of study.},

  abstract = {Psychologists wrestle with how to best handle multiple comparisons, while maintaining a balance between false positives and false negatives. Undercorrection, such as ignoring the presence of multiple comparisons altogether, is known to yield an unacceptably high rate of false positives. Overcorrection, such as treating all tests as independent when they are not, results in overly conservative evaluations of statistical significance. This tutorial demonstrates \$M\_\{eff\}\$ correction, a method for adjusting statistical significance thresholds for multiple comparisons, without the assumption of independence of tests. This method, in which the effective number of tests (\$M\_\{eff\}\$) is estimated from the correlations among the variables being tested, was developed and validated in the field of genetics, but is based on statistical concepts (eigenvalues) that are very familiar to psychologists. \$M\_\{eff\}\$ correction can be applied in psychological research to balance the necessity of correction for multiple comparisons with the concerns that arise from complex, correlated tests.},

These properties help solve some (but not all) of the problems underlying the credibility crisis in psychology. The symmetry of the measure of evidence means that there can be evidence for H0 just as much as for H1; or the Bayes factor may indicate insufficient evidence either way. P-values cannot make this three-way distinction. Thus, Bayes factors indicate when the data count against a theory (and when they count for nothing); and thus they indicate when replications actually support H0 or H1 (in ways that power cannot). There is every reason to publish evidence supporting the null as going against it, because the evidence can be measured to be just as strong either way (thus the published record can be more balanced). Bayes factors can be B-hacked but they mitigate the problem because a) they allow evidence in either direction so people will be less tempted to hack in just one direction; b) as a measure of evidence they are insensitive to the stopping rule; c) families of tests cannot be arbitrarily defined; and d) falsely implying a contrast is planned rather than post hoc becomes irrelevant (though the value of pre-registration is not mitigated).},

  abstract = {No scientific conclusion follows automatically from a statistically non-significant result, yet people routinely use non-significant results to guide conclusions about the status of theories (or the effectiveness of practices). To know whether a non-significant result counts against a theory, or if it just indicates data insensitivity, researchers must use one of: power, intervals (such as confidence or credibility intervals), or else an indicator of the relative evidence for one theory over another, such as a Bayes factor. I argue Bayes factors allow theory to be linked to data in a way that overcomes the weaknesses of the other approaches. Specifically, Bayes factors use the data themselves to determine their sensitivity in distinguishing theories (unlike power), and they make use of those aspects of a theory's predictions that are often easiest to specify (unlike power and intervals, which require specifying the minimal interesting value in order to address theory). Bayes factors provide a coherent approach to determining whether non-significant results support a null hypothesis over a theory, or whether the data are just insensitive. They allow accepting and rejecting the null hypothesis to be put on an equal footing. Concrete examples are provided to indicate the range of application of a simple online Bayes calculator, which reveal both the strengths and weaknesses of Bayes factors.},

Since the decision procedure based on the inclusion of the shortest 90\%-confidence interval in the bioequivalence range is the procedure of choice, and as this is equivalent to the two one-sided tests procedure, the sample size determination is based on the power of the latter. Following the approach of Phillips [1990] for the additive model, corresponding nomograms for the more relevant multiplicative model are given in this paper for various ratios of the expected means for test and reference and various coefficients of variation.},

  abstract = {This paper outlines some of the general considerations which must be taken into account in setting up any practical sampling inspection plan. An economical method of inspection is developed in detail for the case where the purpose of the inspection is to determine the acceptability of discrete lots of a product submitted by a producer. By employing probability theory, the method places a definite barrier in the path of material of defective quality and gives this protection to the consumer with a minimum of inspection expense.},

  abstract = {The research reported on in this article explores the use of social media for work-related or professional purposes. In particular, it focuses on the perceptions and use of social media by academics in the UK. The purpose of the research was to explore the potential social media has to facilitate the changing landscape of higher education and support the individual academic in their role. Of particular interest is how specific social media tools are being used to enhance networking opportunities and contribute to career progression. The use of social media was explored in detail through interviews and a survey. Typical activities that are currently being undertaken were identified and user group profiles developed that articulate different levels of engagement with these tools and the motivations that each group of users have for using social media. The study found that, with increasing levels of activity, the number of motivations for using social media increase, as does the perceived number of successful outcomes, including contributions towards career progression. The main barriers to using social media were identified as a lack of time and skills to undertake these activities, as well as a negative perception of social media. Recommendations for increasing participation are to provide practical training, including the sharing of good practice, and to initiate dialogues within institutions regarding the potential career progression opportunities that social media may afford.},

  abstract = {The perspective that behavior is often driven by unconscious determinants has become widespread in social psychology. Bargh, Chen, and Burrows' (1996) famous study, in which participants unwittingly exposed to the stereotype of age walked slower when exiting the laboratory, was instrumental in defining this perspective. Here, we present two experiments aimed at replicating the original study. Despite the use of automated timing methods and a larger sample, our first experiment failed to show priming. Our second experiment was aimed at manipulating the beliefs of the experimenters: Half were led to think that participants would walk slower when primed congruently, and the other half was led to expect the opposite. Strikingly, we obtained a walking speed effect, but only when experimenters believed participants would indeed walk slower. This suggests that both priming and experimenters' expectations are instrumental in explaining the walking speed effect. Further, debriefing was suggestive of awareness of the primes. We conclude that unconscious behavioral priming is real, while real, involves mechanisms different from those typically assumed to cause the effect.},

  abstract = {Concerns about a lack of reproducibility of statistically significant results have recently been raised in many fields, and it has been argued that this lack comes at substantial economic costs. We here report the results from prediction markets set up to quantify the reproducibility of 44 studies published in prominent psychology journals and replicated in the Reproducibility Project: Psychology. The prediction markets predict the outcomes of the replications well and outperform a survey of market participants' individual forecasts. This shows that prediction markets are a promising tool for assessing the reproducibility of published scientific results. The prediction markets also allow us to estimate probabilities for the hypotheses being true at different testing stages, which provides valuable information regarding the temporal dynamics of scientific discovery. We find that the hypotheses being tested in psychology typically have low prior probabilities of being true (median, 9\%) and that a ``statistically significant'' finding needs to be confirmed in a well-powered replication to have a high probability of being true. We argue that prediction markets could be used to obtain speedy information about reproducibility at low cost and could potentially even be used to determine which studies to replicate to optimally allocate limited resources into replications.},

  abstract = {Social neuroscience has called for new experimental paradigms aimed toward real-time interactions. A distinctive feature of interactions is mutual information exchange: One member of a pair changes in response to the other while simultaneously producing actions that alter the other. Combining mathematical and neurophysiological methods, we introduce a paradigm called the human dynamic clamp (HDC), to directly manipulate the interaction or coupling between a human and a surrogate constructed to behave like a human. Inspired by the dynamic clamp used so productively in cellular neuroscience, the HDC allows a person to interact in real time with a virtual partner itself driven by well-established models of coordination dynamics. People coordinate hand movements with the visually observed movements of a virtual hand, the parameters of which depend on input from the subject's own movements. We demonstrate that HDC can be extended to cover a broad repertoire of human behavior, including rhythmic and discrete movements, adaptation to changes of pacing, and behavioral skill learning as specified by a virtual ``teacher.'' We propose HDC as a general paradigm, best implemented when empirically verified theoretical or mathematical models have been developed in a particular scientific field. The HDC paradigm is powerful because it provides an opportunity to explore parameter ranges and perturbations that are not easily accessible in ordinary human interactions. The HDC not only enables to test the veracity of theoretical models, it also illuminates features that are not always apparent in real-time human social interactions and the brain correlates thereof.},

Some contend that, when the research question relates to improved efficacy or safety, that is, the expected change is in one direction only, the hypothesis test should reflect this by being one-sided. Others insist on the use of a two-sided test in case a treatment difference in the opposite direction to that expected might turn up. We propose an alternative procedure to the two-sided test which also provides protection against overlooking a negative effect. The proposed procedure tests simultaneously for a positive difference and for equivalence. We illustrate the procedure by applying it to the results of a recent clinical trial.},

  abstract = {A consensus meeting was convened by the Initiative on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials (IMMPACT) to provide recommendations for interpreting clinical importance of treatment outcomes in clinical trials of the efficacy and effectiveness of chronic pain treatments. A group of 40 participants from universities, governmental agencies, a patient self-help organization, and the pharmaceutical industry considered methodologic issues and research results relevant to determining the clinical importance of changes in the specific outcome measures previously recommended by IMMPACT for 4 core chronic pain outcome domains: (1) Pain intensity, assessed by a 0 to 10 numerical rating scale; (2) physical functioning, assessed by the Multidimensional Pain Inventory and Brief Pain Inventory interference scales; (3) emotional functioning, assessed by the Beck Depression Inventory and Profile of Mood States; and (4) participant ratings of overall improvement, assessed by the Patient Global Impression of Change scale. It is recommended that 2 or more different methods be used to evaluate the clinical importance of improvement or worsening for chronic pain clinical trial outcome measures. Provisional benchmarks for identifying clinically important changes in specific outcome measures that can be used for outcome studies of treatments for chronic pain are proposed.
Perspective
Systematically collecting and reporting the recommended information needed to evaluate the clinical importance of treatment outcomes of chronic pain clinical trials will allow additional validation of proposed benchmarks and provide more meaningful comparisons of chronic pain treatments.},

  abstract = {The method of agent-based modeling is rarely used in social psychology, but has the potential to complement and improve traditional research practices. An agent-based model (ABM) consists of a number of virtual individuals \textendash{} the ``agents'' \textendash{} interacting in an artificial, experimenter-controlled environment. In this article, we discuss several characteristics of ABMs that could prove particularly useful with respect to recent recommendations aimed at countering issues related to the current ``replication crisis''. We address the potential synergies between planning and implementing an ABM on the one hand, and the endeavor of pre-registration on the other. We introduce ABMs as tools for both the generation and the improvement of theory, testing of hypotheses, and for extending traditional experimental approaches by facilitating the investigation of social processes from the intra-individual all the way up to the societal level. We describe examples of ABMs in social psychology, including a detailed description of the CollAct model of social learning. Finally, limitations and drawbacks of agent-based modeling are discussed. In annex 1 and 2, we provide literature and tool recommendations for getting started with an ABM.},

We make three contributions to harness this potential and to improve the usage and interpretation of non-significant results. To evaluate current practices, we conduct a review of misinterpretations of non-significant p-values in recent educational research. The review indicates that over 90\% of non-significant results are erroneously interpreted as indicating the absence of an effect, or a difference compared to a significant effect. Researchers sometimes link these misinterpretations with potentially erroneous conclusions for educational theory, practice, or policy. To improve the status quo and make non-significant results more informative, we provide a detailed framework based on which researchers can design, conduct, and analyze studies that yield reliable evidence regarding the actual absence of an effect. In addition, we provide a competence model that researchers can use to guide their own research and teaching.},

I show that P values are intimately linked to confidence intervals and to differences in Akaike's information criterion (DAIC), two metrics that have been advocated as replacements for the P value. The choice of a threshold value of DAIC that breaks ties among competing models is as arbitrary as the choice of the probability of a Type I error in hypothesis testing, and several other criticisms of the P value apply equally to DAIC. Since P values, confidence intervals, and DAIC are based on the same statistical information, all have their places in modern statistical practice. The choice of which to use should be stylistic, dictated by details of the application rather than by dogmatic, a priori considerations.},

Additional findings suggest that such results are not simply produced by any negative affective state (Study 3).

To date, however, the causes of WM capacity deficits remain unknown. The present study examined selective attention impairments as a putative contributor to observed capacity deficits in this population. To test this hypothesis, we used an experimental paradigm that assesses the role of selective attention in WM encoding and has been shown to involve the prefrontal cortex and the basal ganglia. In experiment 1, participants were required to remember the locations of 3 or 5 target items (red circles). In another condition, 3-target items were accompanied by 2 distractor items (yellow circles), which participants were instructed to ignore. People with schizophrenia (PSZ) exhibited significant impairment in memory for the locations of target items, consistent with reduced WM capacity, but PSZ and healthy control subjects did not differ in their ability to filter the distractors. This pattern was replicated in experiment 2 for distractors that were more salient. Taken together, these results demonstrate that reduced WM capacity in PSZ is not attributable to a failure of filtering irrelevant distractors.},

After viewing a few organic foods, comfort foods, or control foods, participants who were exposed to organic foods volunteered significantly less time to help a needy stranger, and they judged moral transgressions significantly harsher than those who viewed nonorganic foods.

We tested whether such object words (e.g., head, foot) orient attention toward the location where the denoted object typically occurs (i.e., up, down). Because object words elicit perceptual simulations of the denoted objects (i.e., the representations acquired during actual perception are reactivated), we predicted that an object word would interfere with identification of an unrelated visual target subsequently presented in the object's typical location. Consistent with this prediction, three experiments demonstrated that words denoting objects that typically occur high in the visual field hindered identification of targets appearing at the top of the display, whereas words denoting low objects hindered target identification at the bottom of the display. Thus, object words oriented attention to and activated perceptual simulations in the objects' typical locations. These results shed new light on how language affects perception.},

We compute Bayes factors\textemdash a quantity that can be used to express comparative evidence for an hypothesis but also for the null hypothesis\textemdash for a large subset ( N  = 72) of the original papers and their corresponding replication attempts. In our computation, we take into account the likely scenario that publication bias had distorted the originally published results. Overall, 75\% of studies gave qualitatively similar results in terms of the amount of evidence provided. However, the evidence was often weak (i.e., Bayes factor \&lt; 10). The majority of the studies (64\%) did not provide strong evidence for either the null or the alternative hypothesis in either the original or the replication, and no replication attempts provided strong evidence in favor of the null. In all cases where the original paper provided strong evidence but the replication did not (15\%), the sample size in the replication was smaller than the original. Where the replication provided strong evidence but the original did not (10\%), the replication sample size was larger. We conclude that the apparent failure of the Reproducibility Project to replicate many target effects can be adequately explained by overestimation of effect sizes (or overestimation of evidence against the null hypothesis) due to small sample sizes and publication bias in the psychological literature. We further conclude that traditional sample sizes are insufficient and that a more widespread adoption of Bayesian methods is desirable.},

Once a pair of competing models is fully defined, their definition immediately leads to a measure of how strongly each model supports the data. The ratio of their support is often called the likelihood ratio or the Bayes factor. Critical in the model-selection endeavor is the specification of the models. In the case of hypothesis testing, it is of the greatest importance that the researcher specify exactly what is meant by a ``null'' hypothesis as well as the alternative to which it is contrasted, and that these are suitable instantiations of theoretical positions. Here, we provide an overview of different instantiations of null and alternative hypotheses that can be useful in practice, but in all cases the inferential procedure is based on the same underlying method of likelihood comparison.

We present new data from a student sample and examples from the psychological literature showing the strength and prevalence of this illusion. We identify some intrinsic cognitive mechanisms (similarity to modus tollens reasoning; verbal ambiguity in describing the meaning of significance tests; and the need to rule out chance findings) and extrinsic social pressures which help to maintain the illusion. We conclude by mentioning some alternative methods for presenting and analyzing psychological data, none of which can be considered the ultimate method.},

  abstract = {The hypothesis of a Hierarchy of the Sciences with physical sciences at the top, social sciences at the bottom, and biological sciences in-between is nearly 200 years old. This order is intuitive and reflected in many features of academic life, but whether it reflects the ``hardness'' of scientific research\textemdash i.e., the extent to which research questions and results are determined by data and theories as opposed to non-cognitive factors\textemdash is controversial. This study analysed 2434 papers published in all disciplines and that declared to have tested a hypothesis. It was determined how many papers reported a ``positive'' (full or partial) or ``negative'' support for the tested hypothesis. If the hierarchy hypothesis is correct, then researchers in ``softer'' sciences should have fewer constraints to their conscious and unconscious biases, and therefore report more positive outcomes. Results confirmed the predictions at all levels considered: discipline, domain and methodology broadly defined. Controlling for observed differences between pure and applied disciplines, and between papers testing one or several hypotheses, the odds of reporting a positive result were around 5 times higher among papers in the disciplines of Psychology and Psychiatry and Economics and Business compared to Space Science, 2.3 times higher in the domain of social sciences compared to the physical sciences, and 3.4 times higher in studies applying behavioural and social methodologies on people compared to physical and chemical studies on non-biological material. In all comparisons, biological studies had intermediate values. These results suggest that the nature of hypotheses tested and the logical and methodological rigour employed to test them vary systematically across disciplines and fields, depending on the complexity of the subject matter and possibly other factors (e.g., a field's level of historical and/or intellectual development). On the other hand, these results support the scientific status of the social sciences against claims that they are completely subjective, by showing that, when they adopt a scientific approach to discovery, they differ from the natural sciences only by a matter of degree.},

  abstract = {Despite widespread support from policy makers, funding agencies, and scientific journals, academic researchers rarely make their research data available to others. At the same time, data sharing in research is attributed a vast potential for scientific progress. It allows the reproducibility of study results and the reuse of old data for new research questions. Based on a systematic review of 98 scholarly papers and an empirical survey among 603 secondary data users, we develop a conceptual framework that explains the process of data sharing from the primary researcher's point of view. We show that this process can be divided into six descriptive categories: Data donor, research organization, research community, norms, data infrastructure, and data recipients. Drawing from our findings, we discuss theoretical implications regarding knowledge creation and dissemination as well as research policy measures to foster academic collaboration. We conclude that research data cannot be regarded as knowledge commons, but research policies that better incentivise data sharing are needed to improve the quality of research results and foster scientific progress.},

Hagen and colleagues (Hagen \& Bryant, 2003; Hagen \& Hammerstein, 2009) hypothesized that the intentional enactment of synchronized behavior evolved as a means of signaling coalitional strength, as individuals who can synchronize are able to act in concert in agonistic contexts. Previous research has explored either the subjective consequences of synchrony for participants in synchronized behaviors or the effect of synchrony on observers' impressions of rapport among the synchronized actors. Critically, left untested is the central tenet that, by communicating that the individuals constitute a coordinated unit, synchronized behaviors signal elevated fighting capacity. We tested this prediction in two studies by asking large U.S. samples to judge the envisioned physical formidability \textendash{} previously demonstrated to summarize assessments of diverse determinants of fighting capacity \textendash{} of U.S. soldiers or terrorists on the basis of audio tracks of either synchronous or asynchronous footsteps. Consonant with the agonistic signaling hypothesis, participants judged the synchronized target individuals to be larger and more muscular than the unsynchronized individuals, an effect mediated by their assessment that the former collectively constitute a single unified entity. Although synchronized footsteps also enhanced listeners' perceptions of social bonding among the target individuals, this assessment did not mediate their judgments of elevated formidability, suggesting that synchrony primarily signals fighting capacity via revealed entitativity rather than inferred motivation.},

While the scientific utility of replications is unquestionable, the impact of failed replication efforts and the discussions surrounding them deserve more attention. Specifically, the debates about failed replications on social media have led to worry, in some scientists, regarding reputation. In order to gain data-informed insights into these issues, we collected data from 281 published scientists. We assessed whether scientists overestimate the negative reputational effects of a failed replication in a scenario-based study. Second, we assessed the reputational consequences of admitting wrongness (versus not) as an original scientist of an effect that has failed to replicate. Our data suggests that scientists overestimate the negative reputational impact of a hypothetical failed replication effort. We also show that admitting wrongness about a non-replicated finding is less harmful to one's reputation than not admitting. Finally, we discovered a hint of evidence that feelings about the replication movement can be affected by whether replication efforts are aimed one's own work versus the work of another. Given these findings, we then present potential ways forward in these discussions.},

  abstract = {Since the mid-1980s, confidence intervals (CIs) have been standard in medical journals. We sought lessons for psychology from medicine's experience with statistical reform by investigating two attempts by Kenneth Rothman to change statistical practices. We examined 594 American Journal of Public Health (AJPH) articles published between 1982 and 2000 and 110 Epidemiology articles published in 1990 and 2000. Rothman's editorial instruction to report CIs and not p values was largely effective: In AJPH, sole reliance on p values dropped from 63\% to 5\%, and CI reporting rose from 10\% to 54\%; Epidemiology showed even stronger compliance. However, compliance was superficial: Very few authors referred to CIs when discussing results. The results of our survey support what other research has indicated: Editorial policy alone is not a sufficient mechanism for statistical reform. Achieving substantial, desirable change will require further guidance regarding use and interpretation of CIs and appropriate effect size measures. Necessary steps will include studying researchers' understanding of CIs, improving education, and developing empirically justified recommendations for improved statistical practice.},

Here, we provide an introduction to the four main approaches to epistemic justification, outlining the importance of null results in each and emphasizing the importance of each approach in developing a cumulative scientific literature. We argue that whether or not we subscribe to the Popperian Hypothetico-Deductive (HD) model of science, there is value in adopting Popper's advice about creating bold conjectures and risky tests for establishing the absence (or presence) of effects. However, the most popular approach to statistical testing, Null Hypothesis Significance Testing practice fails at both, and has arguably supported the censoring of null results from our scientific literature. Allowing null results into the scientific literature is essential for a cumulative science to function. However, we argue that even a repaired Popperian HD process won't offer much advice about what are interesting and important absences (or presences) to pursue. For answers to those fundamental questions, we need to appeal to other forms of epistemic justification such as those presented in this article.},

These problems have been articulated by various observers over the years, but are being taken seriously by researchers only slowly, if at all, as evidenced by the continuing emphasis on NHST in statistics classes, statistics textbooks, editorial policies and, of course, the day-to-day practices reported in empirical articles themselves (Cumming et al., 2007).

Although most gripping accomplishments in psychological science testify to the critical role of creative and innovative theorizing (loosening), the ongoing debate on the quality of psychological science is focused almost totally on a restrictive sense of tightening, revolving around statistical hypothesis testing (tightening). A discussion of the imbalance between the conspicuous neglect of theory and the overstated importance of the sacred cow of significance testing raises a skeptical question: Do we seriously believe that stricter compliance rules, exact p values, effect size calculations, new statistics, and monitoring of research practices will foster the growth of excellent science? A more effective strategy would be to start a positive debate that focuses on the best exemplars of strong theorizing and fascinating findings, replacing the focus on insufficient science and unwanted practices.},

It is, however, important to conduct QRP studies with the same scrutiny as all research. We note problems with overestimates of QRP prevalence and the survey methods used in the frequently cited study by John, Loewenstein, and Prelec. In a survey of German psychologists, we decomposed QRP prevalence into its two multiplicative components, proportion of scientists who ever committed a behavior and, if so, how frequently they repeated this behavior across all their research. The resulting prevalence estimates are lower by order of magnitudes. We conclude that inflated prevalence estimates, due to problematic interpretation of survey data, can create a descriptive norm (QRP is normal) that can counteract the injunctive norm to minimize QRPs and unwantedly damage the image of behavioral sciences, which are essential to dealing with many societal problems.},

We derive optimal {$\alpha$}-levels for decision-making by minimizing a cost function that specifies the overall cost of monitoring and management. When managing an economically valuable koala population, it shows that a decision based on {$\alpha~$}=~0.05 carries an expected cost over \$5~million greater than the optimal decision. For a species of such value, there is never any benefit in guarding against the spurious detection of declines and therefore management should proceed directly to recovery action. This result holds in most circumstances where the species' value substantially exceeds its recovery costs. For species of lower economic value, we show that the conventional {$\alpha$}-level of 0.05 rarely approximates the optimal decision-making threshold. This analysis supports calls for reversing the statistical `burden of proof' in environmental decision-making when the cost of Type II errors is relatively high.},

  abstract = {In recent years, a robust movement has emerged within psychology to increase the evidentiary value of our science. This movement, which has analogs throughout the empirical sciences, is broad and diverse, but its primary emphasis has been on the reduction of statistical false positives. The present article addresses epistemological and pragmatic issues that we, as a field, must consider as we seek to maximize the scientific value of this movement. Regarding epistemology, this article contrasts the false-positives-reduction (FPR) approach with an alternative, the error balance (EB) approach, which argues that any serious consideration of optimal scientific practice must contend simultaneously with both false-positive and false-negative errors. Regarding pragmatics, the movement has devoted a great deal of attention to issues that frequently arise in laboratory experiments and one-shot survey studies, but it has devoted less attention to issues that frequently arise in intensive and/or longitudinal studies. We illustrate these epistemological and pragmatic considerations with the case of relationship science, one of the many research domains that frequently employ intensive and/or longitudinal methods. Specifically, we examine 6 research prescriptions that can help to reduce false-positive rates: preregistration, prepublication sharing of materials, postpublication sharing of data, close replication, avoiding piecemeal publication, and increasing sample size. For each, we offer concrete guidance not only regarding how researchers can improve their research practices and balance the risk of false-positive and false-negative errors, but also how the movement can capitalize upon insights from research practices within relationship science to make the movement stronger and more inclusive.},

The tables improve existing SSR techniques by holding alpha very close to a target value when 1\textendash 10 subjects are added at each iteration. The emphasis is on small sample sizes (3\textendash 40 subjects per group) and large standardized effect sizes (0.8\textendash 2.0). The generality of the tables for dependent samples and one-tailed tests is discussed. SSR methods should be of interest to ethics bodies governing research when it is desirable to limit the number of subjects tested, such as in studies of pain, experimental disease, or surgery with animal or human subjects.},

The only difference from regular null hypothesis testing is that criteria for stopping the experiment are obtained from a table based on the desired power, rate of Type I errors, and beginning sample size. The vcSSR was developed using between-subjects ANOVAs, but it should work with p values from any type of F test. In the present study, the {$\alpha$}o remained constant at the nominal level when using the previously published table of criteria with repeated measures designs with various numbers of treatments per subject, Type I error rates, values of {$\rho$}, and four different sample size models. New power curves allow researchers to select the optimal sample size model for a repeated measures experiment. The criteria held {$\alpha$}o constant either when used with a multiple correlation that varied the sample size model and the number of predictor variables, or when used with MANOVA with multiple groups and two levels of a within-subject variable at various levels of {$\rho$}. Although not recommended for use with {$\chi$}2 tests such as the Friedman rank ANOVA test, the vcSSR produces predictable results based on the relation between F and {$\chi$}2. Together, the data confirm the view that the vcSSR can be used to control Type I errors during sequential sampling with any t- or F-statistic rather than being restricted to certain ANOVA designs.},

Experiment 4 found forward and backward affective priming effects in a within-subjects design. Comparison with neutral primes in Experiment 2-4 indicated that the observed affective priming effects were mainly due to inhibition.

Whereas intcractionism stresses the continuity of perceptual and cognitive processes, modularity theory argues for their distinctness. It is argued, in particular, that the apparent plausibility of New Look theorizing derives from the failure to distinguish betwecn the (correct) claim that perceptual processes arc inferential and the (dubious) claim that they are unencapsulated, that is, that they are arbitrarily sensitive to the organism's beliefs and desires. In fact, according to modularity theory, perceptual processes are computationally isolated from much of the background knowledge to which cognitive processes have access. The postulation of autonomous, domain-specific psychological mechanisms underlying perceptual integration connects modularity theory with the tradition of hlCulty psychology, in particular, with the work of Franz Joseph Gall. Some ofthese historical affinities, and some of the relations between faculty psychology and Cartesianism, are discussed in the book.},

The authors show that the average sample size in social-personality research is 104 and that the power to detect the typical effect size in the field is approximately 50\%. Moreover, they show that there is considerable variation among journals in sample sizes and power of the studies they publish, with some journals consistently publishing higher power studies than others.

A scientist making an inference about their data must now decide whether to report a p value, summarize the data with a standardized effect size and its confidence interval, report a Bayes Factor, or use other model comparison methods. To make good choices among these options, it is necessary for researchers to understand the characteristics of the various statistics used by the different analysis frameworks. Toward that end, this paper makes two contributions. First, it shows that for the case of a two-sample t test with known sample sizes, many different summary statistics are mathematically equivalent in the sense that they are based on the very same information in the data set. When the sample sizes are known, the p value provides as much information about a data set as the confidence interval of Cohen's d or a JZS Bayes factor. Second, this equivalence means that different analysis methods differ only in their interpretation of the empirical data. At first glance, it might seem that mathematical equivalence of the statistics suggests that it does not matter much which statistic is reported, but the opposite is true because the appropriateness of a reported statistic is relative to the inference it promotes. Accordingly, scientists should choose an analysis method appropriate for their scientific investigation. A direct comparison of the different inferential frameworks provides some guidance for scientists to make good choices and improve scientific practice.},

To gain a broader perspective, this article applies an objective test for excess success to a large set of articles published in the journal Psychological Science between 2009 and 2012. When empirical studies succeed at a rate much higher than is appropriate for the estimated effects and sample sizes, readers should suspect that unsuccessful findings have been suppressed, the experiments or analyses were improper, or the theory does not properly account for the data. In total, problems appeared for 82 \% (36 out of 44) of the articles in Psychological Science that had four or more experiments and could be analyzed.},

  publisher = {{University of Pittsburgh Press}},
  abstract = {In Shifting Standards, Allan Franklin provides an overview of notable experiments in particle physics. Using papers published in Physical Review,
 the journal of the American Physical Society, as his basis, Franklin 
details the experiments themselves, their data collection, the events 
witnessed, and the interpretation of results. From these papers, he 
distills the dramatic changes to particle physics experimentation from 
1894 through 2009.Franklin develops a framework for his 
analysis, viewing each example according to exclusion and selection of 
data; possible experimenter bias; details of the experimental apparatus;
 size of the data set, apparatus, and number of authors; rates of data 
taking along with analysis and reduction; distinction between ideal and 
actual experiments; historical accounts of previous experiments; and 
personal comments and style.From Millikan's tabletop oil-drop 
experiment to the Compact Muon Solenoid apparatus measuring 
approximately 4,000 cubic meters (not including accelerators) and 
employing over 2,000 authors, Franklin's study follows the 
decade-by-decade evolution of scale and standards in particle physics 
experimentation. As he shows, where once there were only one or two 
collaborators, now it literally takes a village. Similar changes are 
seen in data collection: in 1909 Millikan's data set took 175 oil drops,
 of which he used 23 to determine the value of e, the charge of the 
electron; in contrast, the 1988\textendash 1992 E791 experiment using the Collider 
Detector at Fermilab, investigating the hadroproduction of charm quarks,
 recorded 20 billion events. As we also see, data collection took a 
quantum leap in the 1950s with the use of computers. Events are now 
recorded at rates as of a few hundred per second, and analysis rates 
have progressed similarly.Employing his epistemology of 
experimentation, Franklin deconstructs each example to view the 
arguments offered and the correctness of the results. Overall, he finds 
that despite the metamorphosis of the process, the role of 
experimentation has remained remarkably consistent through the years: to
 test theories and provide factual basis for scientific knowledge, to 
encourage new theories, and to reveal new phenomenon.},

We also asked them to estimate the proportion of their colleagues that use each of these QRPs. Several of the QRPs were prevalent within the ecology and evolution research community. Across the two groups, we found 64\% of surveyed researchers reported they had at least once failed to report results because they were not statistically significant (cherry picking); 42\% had collected more data after inspecting whether results were statistically significant (a form of p hacking) and 51\% had reported an unexpected finding as though it had been hypothesised from the start (HARKing). Such practices have been directly implicated in the low rates of reproducible results uncovered by recent large scale replication studies in psychology and other disciplines. The rates of QRPs found in this study are comparable with the rates seen in psychology, indicating that the reproducibility problems discovered in psychology are also likely to be present in ecology and evolution.},

We took advantage of a well-known spatial modulation (prismatic adaptation) to test the hypothesis that the representation of time is spatially oriented from left to right, with smaller time intervals being represented to the left of larger time intervals. Healthy subjects performed a time-reproduction task and a time-bisection task, before and after leftward and rightward prismatic adaptation. Results showed that prismatic adaptation inducing a rightward orientation of spatial attention produced an overestimation of time intervals, whereas prismatic adaptation inducing a leftward shift of spatial attention produced an underestimation of time intervals. These findings not only confirm that temporal intervals are represented as horizontally arranged in space, but also reveal that spatial modulation of time processing most likely occurs via cuing of spatial attention, and that spatial attention can influence the spatial coding of quantity in different dimensions.},

Recent studies of the nonlinear dynamics of the primary sensory cortices have shown that the patterns that are constructed by chaotic nonlinear dynamics in cortical neuropil replace stimulus driven activity. This finding supports the concept that knowledge in brains is entirely constructed within them without direct transfer of information from outside. As knowledge increases by learning, brains of individuals grow progressively apart. The separation results from the uniqueness of the knowledge that is constructed within each brain. The resulting condition of isolation is known among philosophers as epistemological solipsism. This view is reinforced by the tenets of aesthetics, which emphasize the deeply personal experiences of individuals, not as active listeners but as passive recipients of beauty in music and other arts. Neither conventional neuroscience nor aesthetics can explain the deep emotional power of music to move humans to action.},

However, relevant information is usually accompanied by information that is irrelevant for the selection of action. Recent studies showed that even irrelevant information is bound into event files. In this study, we investigated the boundary conditions of distractor-response binding and subsequent distractorbased response retrieval processes. In particular, we tested whether the inclusion of distractor information into S-R episodes is modulated by whether the distractor and target stimulus are perceived as belonging to the same object or as belonging to different objects. We argue that distracting information is only bound into S-R episodes if it is perceived as belonging to the same object as the relevant information whereas no binding occurs when the distracting information is perceived as belonging to a separate object. In six experiments, we found evidence for the modulation of distractor-response bindings according to perceptual grouping principles.},

Our research performed over the last 20 years has sought to understand how the mutuality, accommodation, and synchrony found in everyday interactional coordination can be understood using a dynamical theory of behavioral order, namely coordination dynamics. Using laboratory interpersonal tasks, we have demonstrated that when two people are asked to rhythmically coordinate their limbs they show behavioral phenomena identical to those found in bimanual interlimb coordination, which has been mathematically modeled as a dynamical process. Research has demonstrated that these same dynamical organizing principles can coordinate the rhythmic movements of two people unintentionally and that the weaker, intermittent coordination that ensues is affected by both perceptual (e.g., attentional focus and information pickup activity of the visual system) and dynamical constraints (e.g., intrapersonal rhythmic synergies and period basin of entrainment). Other research has investigated how traditional social and personality properties of a dyad (rapport, social competence) relate to dynamical properties of a dyad's coordinated movements and how the stability of coordinated movements mirrors the stability of mental connectedness experienced in social interactions.},

Visual and auditory stimuli were, respectively, a luminance-modulated Gaussian blob and an amplitude-modulated white noise. Tactile stimuli were mechanical vibrations presented to the index finger. All the stimuli were temporally modulated by either single pulses or repetitive-pulse trains. The results show that the temporal resolution of synchrony perception was similar for AV and VT (e.g., \textasciitilde 4~Hz for repetitive-pulse stimuli), but significantly higher for AT (\textasciitilde 10~Hz). Apart from having a higher temporal resolution, however, AT synchrony perception was similar to AV synchrony perception in that participants could select matching features through attention, and a change in the matching-feature attribute had little effect on temporal resolution.

  abstract = {Background
In the literature we find many indices of size of treatment effect (effect size: ES). The preferred index of treatment effect in evidence-based medicine is the number needed to treat (NNT), while the most common one in the medical literature is Cohen's d when the outcome is continuous. There is confusion about how to convert Cohen's d into NNT.

Methods
We conducted meta-analyses of individual patient data from 10 randomized controlled trials of second generation antipsychotics for schizophrenia (n{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}4278) to produce Cohen's d and NNTs for various definitions of response, using cutoffs of 10\% through 90\% reduction on the symptom severity scale. These actual NNTs were compared with NNTs calculated from Cohen's d according to two proposed methods in the literature (Kraemer, et al., Biological Psychiatry, 2006; Furukawa, Lancet, 1999).

Results
NNTs from Kraemer's method overlapped with the actual NNTs in 56\%, while those based on Furukawa's method fell within the observed ranges of NNTs in 97\% of the examined instances. For various definitions of response corresponding with 10\% through 70\% symptom reduction where we observed a non-small number of responders, the degree of agreement for the former method was at a chance level (ANOVA ICC of 0.12, p{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.22) but that for the latter method was ANOVA ICC of 0.86 (95\%CI: 0.55 to 0.95, p{$<$}0.01).

Conclusions
Furukawa's method allows more accurate prediction of NNTs from Cohen's d. Kraemer's method gives a wrong impression that NNT is constant for a given d even when the event rate differs.},

We compare responses to dyadic conversations in four mediated conditions: video, audio-only, and two avatar conditions. The avatar conditions differed only in their treatment of eye gaze. In the random-gaze condition the avatar's head and eye animations were unrelated to conversational flow. In the informed-gaze condition, they were related to turn-taking during the conversation. The head animations were tracked and the eye animations were inferred from the audio stream. Our comparative analysis of 100 post-experiment questionnaires showed that the random-gaze avatar did not improve on audio-only communication. The informed-gaze avatar significantly outperformed the random-gaze model and also outperformed audio-only on several response measures. We conclude that an avatar whose gaze behaviour is related to the conversation provides a marked improvement on an avatar that merely exhibits liveliness.},

Confidence intervals present a range of values, on the basis of the sample data, in which the population value for such a difference may lie. Some methods of calculating confidence intervals for means and differences between means are given, with similar information for proportions. The paper also gives suggestions for graphical display.},

  abstract = {Four experiments examined whether spatial reasoning about non-spatial concepts is based on mapping concepts to space according to similarities in relational structure. Sixand 7-year-old children without any prior graphing experience were asked to reason with graph-like diagrams. In Experiments 1 and 2, children were taught to map time and quantity to vertical and horizontal lines, and then were asked to judge the relative value of a second-order variable (rate) or a first-order variable (quantity) represented in a function line. Children's judgments indicated that they mapped concepts to space by aligning similar relational structures: quantity judgments corresponded to line height, and rate judgments corresponded to line slope. These correspondences entail a mapping of first-order concepts to first-order spatial dimensions and second-order concepts to second-order spatial dimensions. Experiments 3 and 4 investigated the role of context in establishing relational structure. Children were taught to map age and rate (Experiment 3) or age and size (Experiment 4) to vertical and horizontal lines, and were then asked to judge the rate or the size represented by a function line. In this context, both rate and size were first-order variables, and children's judgments corresponded to line height, also a first-order variable. The results indicate that spatial reasoning involves a structure-sensitive mapping between concepts and space.},

  abstract = {Winner of the 2016 De Groot Prize from the International Society for Bayesian Analysis Now in its third edition, this classic book is widely considered the leading text on Bayesian methods, lauded for its accessible, practical approach to analyzing data and solving research problems. Bayesian Data Analysis, Third Edition continues to take an applied approach to analysis using up-to-date Bayesian methods. The authors\rule{1em}{1pt}all leaders in the statistics community\rule{1em}{1pt}introduce basic concepts from a data-analytic perspective before presenting advanced methods. Throughout the text, numerous worked examples drawn from real applications and research emphasize the use of Bayesian inference in practice. New to the Third Edition   Four new chapters on nonparametric modeling Coverage of weakly informative priors and boundary-avoiding priors Updated discussion of cross-validation and predictive information criteria Improved convergence monitoring and effective sample size calculations for iterative simulation Presentations of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, variational Bayes, and expectation propagation New and revised software code   The book can be used in three different ways. For undergraduate students, it introduces Bayesian inference starting from first principles. For graduate students, the text presents effective current approaches to Bayesian modeling and computation in statistics and related fields. For researchers, it provides an assortment of Bayesian methods in applied statistics. Additional materials, including data sets used in the examples, solutions to selected exercises, and software instructions, are available on the book's web page.},

  abstract = {A substantial school in the philosophy of science identifies Bayesian inference with inductive inference and even rationality as such, and seems to be strengthened by the rise and practical success of Bayesian statistics. We argue that the most successful forms of Bayesian statistics do not actually support that particular philosophy but rather accord much better with sophisticated forms of hypothetico-deductivism. We examine the actual role played by prior distributions in Bayesian models, and the crucial aspects of model checking and model revision, which fall outside the scope of Bayesian confirmation theory. We draw on the literature on the consistency of Bayesian updating and also on our experience of applied work in social science. Clarity about these matters should benefit not just philosophy of science, but also statistical practice. At best, the inductivist view has encouraged researchers to fit and compare models without checking them; at worst, theorists have actively discouraged practitioners from performing model checking because it does not fit into their framework.},

  abstract = {Kinematic analysis of lip and voice spectrum analysis were used to assess the in\textasciimacron uence of both execution and observation of arm{$\pm$} mouth-related actions on speech production. In experiments 1 and 2 participants brought either a cherry or an apple to their mouth and either pronounced the syllable BA (experiment 1) or emitted a nonspeech-related vocalization (experiment 2). In the other three experiments participants observed arm actions performed by the experimenter and pronounced the syllable BA. In experiment 3, they observed the action of bringing the cherry or apple to the mouth. In experiments 4 and 5, they observed a pantomime of the same action performed by the experimenter with his own arm (experiment 4) or with a nonbiological arm (experiment 5). The results showed that the formant 2 of the vowel `a' increased when participants executed the bringing-to-the-mouth act with the apple or observed its execution or pantomime with the experimenter's arm (experiments 1, 3 and 4). In contrast, no modi\textregistered cation in the vowel formants was found during a nonspeech-related vocalization (experiment 2) and during observation of an action with a nonbiological arm (experiment 5). Finally, the opening of the lips was larger when the participant brought the apple rather than the cherry to the mouth and pronounced BA (experiment 1). Taken together, the results of the present study suggest that the execution and observation of the bringing-to-the-mouth action activate a mouth articulation posture (probably due to the act of food manipulation with the mouth) which selectively in\textasciimacron uences speech production. They support the idea that the system involved in speech production shares and may derive from the neural substrate which is involved in the control of arm{$\pm$}mouth interactions and, in general, of arm actions.},

Secondly, a taxonomy of descriptive arguments is offered, emphasizing the diversity contained within this genre of empirical analysis. Thirdly, the demise of description within political science is charted over the past century, with comparisons to other disciplines. Fourthly, it is argued that the task of description ought to be approached independently, not merely as a handmaiden of causal theories. Fifthly, the methodological difficulties of descriptive inference are addressed. Finally, fruitful research areas within the rubric of description are reviewed.},

Incentives, perhaps: underpowered research benefits researchers individually (increased productivity), but harms science collectively (inflated Type I error rates and effect size estimates but low replication rates). Yet, researchers can selectively reward power at various scientific bottlenecks (e.g., peer review, hiring, funding, and promotion). We designed a stylized thought experiment to evaluate the degree to which researchers consider power and productivity in hiring decisions. Accomplished psychologists chose between a low sample size candidate and a high sample size candidate who were otherwise identical. We manipulated the degree to which participants received information about (1) productivity, (2) sample size, and (3) directly calculable Type I error and replication rates. Participants were intolerant of the negative consequences of low-power research, yet merely indifferent regarding the practices that logically produce those consequences, unless those consequences were made quite explicit.},

Most theories in cognitive science view meaning in terms of propositional structures that may be combined to form higher-order complexes in representing the meanings of conversations and texts. A newer approach seeks to capture meaning in terms of high-dimensional semantic space. Both views reflect the idea that meaning is best understood as abstract and disembodied symbols. My aim in this article is to make the case for an embodied view of linguistic meaning. This view provides a challenge to traditional approaches to linguistic meaning (although may not necessarily be entirely incompatible with them). I discuss several new lines of research from both linguistics and psychology that explore the importance of embodied perception and action in people\~Os understanding of words, phrases, and texts. These data provide strong evidence in favor of the idea that significant aspects of thought and language arises from, and is grounded in, embodiment.},

  abstract = {Heuristics are efficient cognitive processes that ignore information. In contrast to the widely held view that less processing reduces accuracy, the study of heuristics shows that less information, computation, and time can in fact improve accuracy. We review the major progress made so far: (a) the discovery of less-is-more effects; (b) the study of the ecological rationality of heuristics, which examines in which environments a given strategy succeeds or fails, and why; (c) an advancement from vague labels to computational models of heuristics; (d) the development of a systematic theory of heuristics that identifies their building blocks and the evolved capacities they exploit, and views the cognitive system as relying on an ``adaptive toolbox;'' and (e) the development of an empirical methodology that accounts for individual differences, conducts competitive tests, and has provided evidence for people's adaptive use of heuristics. Homo heuristicus has a biased mind and ignores part of the available information, yet a biased mind can handle uncertainty more efficiently and robustly than an unbiased mind relying on more resource-intensive and general-purpose processing strategies.},

  abstract = {The ``replication crisis'' has been attributed to misguided external incentives gamed by researchers (the strategic-game hypothesis). Here, I want to draw attention to a complementary internal factor, namely, researchers' widespread faith in a statistical ritual and associated delusions (the statistical-ritual hypothesis). The ``null ritual,'' unknown in statistics proper, eliminates judgment precisely at points where statistical theories demand it. The crucial delusion is that the p value specifies the probability of a successful replication (i.e., 1 \textendash{} p), which makes replication studies appear to be superfluous. A review of studies with 839 academic psychologists and 991 students shows that the replication delusion existed among 20\% of the faculty teaching statistics in psychology, 39\% of the professors and lecturers, and 66\% of the students. Two further beliefs, the illusion of certainty (e.g., that statistical significance proves that an effect exists) and Bayesian wishful thinking (e.g., that the probability of the alternative hypothesis being true is 1 \textendash{} p), also make successful replication appear to be certain or almost certain, respectively. In every study reviewed, the majority of researchers (56\%\textendash 97\%) exhibited one or more of these delusions. Psychology departments need to begin teaching statistical thinking, not rituals, and journal editors should no longer accept manuscripts that report results as ``significant'' or ``not significant.''},

Barriers to more widespread use of open review include conservatism within the research community and the fact that openness makes editors publicly responsible for their choice of reviewers and their interpretation of reviewers' comments. Forces for change include the growing use of preprint servers combined with open commentary. I look forward to a time when open commentary and review replace the current, flawed system of closed prepublication peer review and its false reassurances about the reliability of what is published.},

The important question debated is not if it should be used, but rather when it should be used. Kimmel (1957; see record 1959-03845-001) has recently attempted to resolve the controversy by suggesting criteria for the use of one-tailed tests. He maintains that one-tailed tests may be used when results in the opposite direction: (a) will not be used to determine any new course of behavior, (b) will be psychologically meaningless, or (c) cannot be deduced by any psychological theory, while an outcome in the expected direction can. It is these last two instances that will be dealt with in this paper. The current author suggests that the criteria of theoretical predictability and psychological meaninglessness are not as decisive as they may appear to be. He argues that the decision to use a one-tailed test should be made in light of the difficulties with which the investigator is confronted when the results occur in the "unexpected" direction.},

We conclude that the simulation approach offers the best explanation of the data. What computational steps might be used, however, in simulation-style emotion detection? Four alternative models are explored: a generate-and-test model, a reverse simulation model, a variant of the reverse simulation model that employs an ``as if'' loop, and an unmediated resonance model.},

  abstract = {Background
Depression is common in primary care and clinicians are encouraged to screen their patients. Meta-analyses have evaluated the effectiveness of screening, but two author groups consistently reached completely opposite conclusions.

Methods
We identified five systematic reviews on depression screening conducted between 2001 and 2009, three by Gilbody and colleagues and two by the United States Preventive Task Force. The two author groups consistently reached completely opposite conclusions. We analyzed two contemporaneous systematic reviews, applying a stepwise approach to unravel their methods. Decision points were identified, and discrepancies between systematic reviews authors' justification of choices made were recorded.

Results
Two systematic reviews each addressing three research questions included 26 randomized controlled trials with different combinations in each review. For the outcome depression screening resulting in treatment, both reviews undertook meta-analyses of imperfectly overlapping studies. Two in particular, pooled each by only one of the reviews, influenced the recommendations in opposite directions. Justification for inclusion or exclusion of studies was obtuse.

Conclusion
Systematic reviews may be less objective than assumed. Based on this analysis of two meta-analyses we hypothesise that strongly held prior beliefs (confirmation bias) may have influenced inclusion and exclusion criteria of studies, and their interpretation. Authors should be required to declare a priori any strongly held prior beliefs within their hypotheses, before embarking on systematic reviews.},

  abstract = {ContextMeta-analysis of trials that have used different continuous or rating scales to record outcomes of a similar nature requires sophisticated data handling and data transformation to a uniform scale, the standardized mean difference (SMD). It is not known how reliable such meta-analyses are.ObjectiveTo study whether SMDs in meta-analyses are accurate.Data SourcesSystematic review of meta-analyses published in 2004 that reported a result as an SMD, with no language restrictions. Two trials were randomly selected from each meta-analysis. We attempted to replicate the results in each meta-analysis by independently calculating SMD using Hedges adjusted g.Data ExtractionOur primary outcome was the proportion of meta-analyses for which our result differed from that of the authors by 0.1 or more, either for the point estimate or for its confidence interval, for at least 1 of the 2 selected trials. We chose 0.1 as cut point because many commonly used treatments have an effect of 0.1 to 0.5, compared with placebo.ResultsOf the 27 meta-analyses included in this study, we could not replicate the result for at least 1 of the 2 trials within 0.1 in 10 of the meta-analyses (37\%), and in 4 cases, the discrepancy was 0.6 or more for the point estimate. Common problems were erroneous number of patients, means, standard deviations, and sign for the effect estimate. In total, 17 meta-analyses (63\%) had errors for at least 1 of the 2 trials examined. For the 10 meta-analyses with errors of at least 0.1, we checked the data from all the trials and conducted our own meta-analysis, using the authors' methods. Seven of these 10 meta-analyses were erroneous (70\%); 1 was subsequently retracted, and in 2 a significant difference disappeared or appeared.ConclusionsThe high proportion of meta-analyses based on SMDs that show errors indicates that although the statistical process is ostensibly simple, data extraction is particularly liable to errors that can negate or even reverse the findings of the study. This has implications for researchers and implies that all readers, including journal reviewers and policy makers, should approach such meta-analyses with caution.},

  abstract = {This study examined the relative impact different channels of communication had on social perception based on exposure to thin slices of the behavioral stream. Specifically, we tested the hypothesis that dyadic rapport can be perceived quickly through visual channels. Perceivers judged the rapport in 50 target interactions in one of five stimulus display conditions: transcript, audio, video, video+ transcript, or video + audio. The data demonstrated that perceivers with access to nonverbal, visual information were the most accurate perceivers of dyadic rapport. Their judgments were found to covary with the visually encoded features that past research has linked with rapport expression. This suggests the presence of a nonverbally based implicit theory of rapport that more or less matches the natural ecology, at least as it occurs within brief samples of the behavioral stream.},

This problem arises via selective choice of parameters at which power is calculated, but can also arise if one computes power at a prespecified alternative. As noted by earlier authors, power computed using sample estimates (``observed power'') replaces this problem with even more counterintuitive behavior, because observed power effectively double counts the data and increases as the P~value declines. Use of power to analyze and interpret data thus needs more extensive discouragement.},

In some fields of ecology and environmental sciences, the application of statistical methods is also regulated by ordinance. Over the past 20years, ecologists and environmental scientists have argued against an unthinking application of null hypothesis significance tests. More recently, Canadian ecologists have suggested a new approach to significance testing, taking account of the costs of both type I and type II errors. In this paper, we investigate the implications of this for testing in drug development and demonstrate that its adoption leads directly to the likelihood principle and Bayesian approaches.

  abstract = {Inducing causal relationships from observations is a classic problem in scientific inference, statistics, and machine learning. It is also a central part of human learning, and a task that people perform remarkably well given its notorious difficulties. People can learn causal structure in various settings, from diverse forms of data: observations of the co-occurrence frequencies between causes and effects, interactions between physical objects, or patterns of spatial or temporal coincidence. These different modes of learning are typically thought of as distinct psychological processes and are rarely studied together, but at heart they present the same inductive challenge\textemdash identifying the unobservable mechanisms that generate observable relations between variables, objects, or events, given only sparse and limited data. We present a computational-level analysis of this inductive problem and a framework for its solution, which allows us to model all these forms of causal learning in a common language. In this framework, causal induction is the product of domain-general statistical inference guided by domain-specific prior knowledge, in the form of an abstract causal theory. We identify 3 key aspects of abstract prior knowledge\textemdash the ontology of entities, properties, and relations that organizes a domain; the plausibility of specific causal relationships; and the functional form of those relationships\textemdash and show how they provide the constraints that people need to induce useful causal models from sparse data.},

  abstract = {"Noted for its comprehensive coverage, this greatly expanded new edition now covers the use of univariate and multivariate effect sizes. A variety of measures and estimators are reviewed along with their application, interpretation, and limitations. Noted for its practical approach, the book features numerous examples using real data for a variety of variables and designs, to help readers apply the material to their own data. Tips on the use of SPSS, SAS, R, And S-Plus are provided for the more tedious calculations. The book's broad disciplinary appeal results from its inclusion of a variety of examples from psychology, medicine, education, and other social sciences. Special attention is paid to confidence intervals, the statistical assumptions of the methods, and robust estimators of effect sizes. The extensive reference section is appreciated by all. With more than 40\% new material, highlights of the new edition include: Three new multivariate chapters covering effect sizes for analysis of covariance, multiple regression/correlation, and multivariate analysis of variance. More learning tools in each chapter including introductions, summaries, "Tips and Pitfalls" and more conceptual and computational questions. More coverage of univariate effect sizes, confidence intervals, and effect sizes for repeated measures to reflect their increased use in research. More software references for calculating effect sizes and their confidence intervals including SPSS, SAS, R, and S-Plus. The data used in the book is now provided on the web along with suggested calculations for computational practice. Effect Sizes for Research, 2nd Edition covers standardized and unstandardized differences between means, correlational measures, strength of association, and parametric and nonparametric measures for between- and within-groups data. The book clearly demonstrates how the choice of an appropriate measure depends on such factors as whether variables are categorical, ordinal, or continuous; satisfying assumptions; sampling; and the source of variability in the population. Background information on multivariate statistics is provided for those who need it. Intended as a resource for professionals, researchers, and advanced students in a variety of fields, this book is also an excellent supplement for advanced statistics courses in psychology, education, the social sciences, business, and medicine. A prerequisite of introductory statistics through factorial analysis of variance and chi-square is recommended"--},

  abstract = {When a new process is suggested for use in agriculture or technology it is usually necessary to carry out experiments to estimate the increase in output that would result if the new process replaced that in current use. If the cost of experimentation and the scale of potential application of the new process are known, one method of arriving at an optimum amount of experimentation is to minimize the total risk given by the sum of the cost of the experiment plus the expected loss due to wrong decisions. The main difficulty is that the last quantity depends on the true increase in output due to introducing the new treatment, which can only be estimated from the results of the experiments. The paper discusses the case where an initial experiment is carried out, and it is required to decide whether to accept or reject the new treatment at once or else to carry out further experimentation. In the latter case the optimum amount of further experimentation has also to be decided. A solution is provided by minimizing the risk after eliminating the unknown parameter by averaging over its fiducial distribution based on the evidence from the initial experiment. Means for applying the resulting decision rule in practice are provided, and its performance under various circumstances is discussed.},

  abstract = {We present a new theory of hypothesis testing. The main concept is the S-value, a notion of evidence which, unlike p-values, allows for effortlessly combining evidence from several tests, even in the common scenario where the decision to perform a new test depends on the previous test outcome: safe tests based on S-values generally preserve Type-I error guarantees under such "optional continuation". S-values exist for completely general testing problems with composite null and alternatives. Their prime interpretation is in terms of gambling or investing, each S-value corresponding to a particular investment. Surprisingly, optimal "GROW" S-values, which lead to fastest capital growth, are fully characterized by the joint information projection (JIPr) between the set of all Bayes marginal distributions on H0 and H1. Thus, optimal S-values also have an interpretation as Bayes factors, with priors given by the JIPr. We illustrate the theory using two classical testing scenarios: the one-sample t-test and the 2x2 contingency table. In the t-test setting, GROW s-values correspond to adopting the right Haar prior on the variance, like in Jeffreys' Bayesian t-test. However, unlike Jeffreys', the "default" safe t-test puts a discrete 2-point prior on the effect size, leading to better behavior in terms of statistical power. Sharing Fisherian, Neymanian and Jeffreys-Bayesian interpretations, S-values and safe tests may provide a methodology acceptable to adherents of all three schools.},

  abstract = {According to the strength model, self-control is a finite resource that determines capacity for effortful control over dominant responses and, once expended, leads to impaired self-control task performance, known as ego depletion. A meta-analysis of 83 studies tested the effect of ego depletion on task performance and related outcomes, alternative explanations and moderators of the effect, and additional strength model hypotheses. Results revealed a significant effect of ego depletion on self-control task performance. Significant effect sizes were found for ego depletion on effort, perceived difficulty, negative affect, subjective fatigue, and blood glucose levels. Small, nonsignificant effects were found for positive affect and self-efficacy. Moderator analyses indicated minimal variation in the effect across sphere of depleting and dependent task, frequently used depleting and dependent tasks, presentation of tasks as single or separate experiments, type of dependent measure and control condition task, and source laboratory. The effect size was moderated by depleting task duration, task presentation by the same or different experimenters, intertask interim period, dependent task complexity, and use of dependent tasks in the choice and volition and cognitive spheres. Motivational incentives, training on self-control tasks, and glucose supplementation promoted better self-control in ego-depleted samples. Expecting further acts of self-control exacerbated the effect. Findings provide preliminary support for the ego-depletion effect and strength model hypotheses. Support for motivation and fatigue as alternative explanations for ego depletion indicate a need to integrate the strength model with other theories. Findings provide impetus for future investigation testing additional hypotheses and mechanisms of the ego-depletion effect.},

Despite the enormous amount of attention given to this topic, psychology's understanding of ToSS remains deficient. The major problem stems from a widespread and uncritical acceptance of null hypothesis significance testing (NHST), which is an indefensible amalgam of ideas adapted from Fisher's thinking on the subject and from Neyman and Pearson's alternative account. To correct for the deficiencies of the hybrid, it is suggested that psychology avail itself of two important and more recent viewpoints on ToSS, namely the neo-Fisherian and the error-statistical perspectives. The neo-Fisherian perspective endeavors to improve on Fisher's original account and rejects key elements of Neyman and Pearson's alternative. In contrast, the error-statistical perspective builds on the strengths of both statistical traditions. It is suggested that these more recent outlooks on ToSS are a definite improvement on NHST, especially the error-statistical position. It is suggested that ToSS can play a useful, if limited, role in psychological research. At the end, some lessons learnt from the extensive debates about ToSS are presented.},

I also show how this error-statistical perspective improves our understanding of the nature of science by adopting a workable process of falsification and by structuring inquiry in terms of a hierarchy of models. Before concluding, I briefly discuss the importance of the philosophy of statistics for improving our understanding of statistical thinking.},

  abstract = {Collaborations among researchers and across disciplinary, organizational, and cultural boundaries are vital to address increasingly complex challenges and opportunities in science and society. In addition, unprecedented technological advances create new opportunities to capitalize on a broader range of expertise and information in scientific collaborations. Yet rapid increases in the demand for scientific collaborations have outpaced changes in the factors needed to support teams in science, such as institutional structures and policies, scientific culture, and funding opportunities. The Science of Team Science (SciTS) field arose with the goal of empirically addressing questions from funding agencies, administrators, and scientists regarding the value of team science (TS) and strategies for successfully leading, engaging in, facilitating, and supporting science teams. Closely related fields have rich histories studying teams, groups, organizations, and management and have built a body of evidence for effective teaming in contexts such as industry and the military. Yet few studies had focused on science teams. Unique contextual factors within the scientific enterprise create an imperative to study these teams in context, and provide opportunities to advance understanding of other complex forms of collaboration. This review summarizes the empirical findings from the SciTS literature, which center around five key themes: the value of TS, team composition and its influence on TS performance, formation of science teams, team processes central to effective team functioning, and institutional influences on TS. Cross-cutting issues are discussed in the context of new research opportunities to further advance SciTS evidence and better inform policies and practices for effective TS.},

Results showed that Cohen's U3 was rated as most informative.  For example, 77\% of participants found it more informative than Cohen's d.

        Methods:~A reanalysis of 2 controlled clinical trials for pain in persons with disabilities. Eighty-two persons with spinal cord injuries and 34 persons with amputations provided pretreatment and posttreatment ratings of pain intensity on 0 to 10 numerical rating scales. After treatment, participants also rated the meaningfulness of any changes in pain they experienced.
        Results:~An average decrease of 1.80 points on the 0 to 10 numerical rating scales and percent decreases of about 36\% corresponded to reports of a meaningful change in pain. There was no significant difference between samples, and also no differences due to gender or treatment condition. Age and pretreatment pain, however, were associated with the amount of pain decrease rated as meaningful. The change in pain intensity rated as meaningful was greater for older participants and participants with higher levels of pretreatment pain. Consistent with previous research, percent change scores were less biased by pretreatment pain than were absolute change scores.
        Discussion:~These findings are generally consistent with similar findings in other pain populations, and, in light of previous research, support an approximate 33\% decrease in pain as a reasonable standard for meaningful change across chronic pain conditions. Percent change scores may be more useful for comparing the effects of pain treatments across samples or conditions because they are less biased by pretreatment pain level.},

  abstract = {Field surveys of biological responses can provide valuable information about environmental status and anthropogenic stress. However, it is quite usual for biological variables to differ between sites or change between two periods of time also in the absence of an impact. This means that there is an obvious risk that natural variation will be interpreted as environmental impact, or that relevant effects will be missed due to insufficient statistical power. Furthermore, statistical methods tend to focus on the risks for Type-I error, i.e. false positives. For environmental management, the risk for false negatives is (at least) equally important. The aim of the present study was to investigate how the probabilities for false positives and negatives are affected by experimental set up (number of reference sites and samples per site), decision criteria (statistical method and {$\alpha$}-level) and effect size. A model was constructed to simulate data from multiple reference sites, a negative control and a positive control. The negative control was taken from the same distribution as the reference sites and the positive control was just outside the normal range. Using the model, the probabilities to get false positives and false negatives were calculated when a conventional statistical test, based on a null hypothesis of no difference, was used along with alternative tests that were based on the normal range of natural variation. Here, it is tested if an investigated site is significantly inside (equivalence test) and significantly outside (interval test) the normal range. Furthermore, it was tested how the risks for false positives and false negatives are affected by changes in {$\alpha$}-level and effect size. The results of the present study show that the strategy that best balances the risks between false positives and false negatives is to use the equivalence test. Besides tests with tabulated p-values, estimates generated using a bootstrap routine were included in the present study. The simulations showed that the probability for management errors was smaller for the bootstrap compared to the traditional test and the interval test.},

  abstract = {Access to data is a critical feature of an efficient, progressive and ultimately self-correcting scientific ecosystem. But the extent to which in-principle benefits of data sharing are realized in practice is unclear. Crucially, it is largely unknown whether published findings can be reproduced by repeating reported analyses upon shared data (`analytic reproducibility'). To investigate this, we conducted an observational evaluation of a mandatory open data policy introduced at the journal Cognition. Interrupted time-series analyses indicated a substantial post-policy increase in data available statements (104/417, 25\% pre-policy to 136/174, 78\% post-policy), although not all data appeared reusable (23/104, 22\% pre-policy to 85/136, 62\%, post-policy). For 35 of the articles determined to have reusable data, we attempted to reproduce 1324 target values. Ultimately, 64 values could not be reproduced within a 10\% margin of error. For 22 articles all target values were reproduced, but 11 of these required author assistance. For 13 articles at least one value could not be reproduced despite author assistance. Importantly, there were no clear indications that original conclusions were seriously impacted. Mandatory open data policies can increase the frequency and quality of data sharing. However, suboptimal data curation, unclear analysis specification and reporting errors can impede analytic reproducibility, undermining the utility of data sharing and the credibility of scientific findings.},

Although the viewpoints span a range of perspectives, the overriding theme that emerges states that significance testing may still be useful if supplemented with some or all of the following -- Bayesian logic, caution, confidence intervals, effect sizes and power, other goodness of approximation measures, replication and meta-analysis, sound reasoning, and theory appraisal and corroboration. The book is organized into five general areas. The first presents an overview of significance testing issues that sythesizes the highlights of the remainder of the book. The next discusses the debate in which significance testing should be rejected or retained. The third outlines various methods that may supplement current significance testing procedures. The fourth discusses Bayesian approaches and methods and the use of confidence intervals versus significance tests. The last presents the philosophy of science perspectives. Rather than providing definitive prescriptions, the chapters are largely suggestive of general issues, concerns, and application guidelines. The editors allow readers to choose the best way to conduct hypothesis testing in their respective fields. For anyone doing research in the social sciences, this book is bound to become "must" reading.},

  abstract = {Being able to interpret `null effects?is important for cumulative knowledge generation in science. To draw informative conclusions from null-effects, researchers need to move beyond the incorrect interpretation of a non-significant result in a null-hypothesis significance test as evidence of the absence of an effect. We explain how to statistically evaluate null-results using equivalence tests, Bayesian estimation, and Bayes factors. A worked example demonstrates how to apply these statistical tools and interpret the results. Finally, we explain how no statistical approach can actually prove that the null-hypothesis is true, and briefly discuss the philosophical differences between statistical approaches to examine null-effects. The increasing availability of easy-to-use software and online tools to perform equivalence tests, Bayesian estimation, and calculate Bayes factors make it timely and feasible to complement or move beyond traditional null-hypothesis tests, and allow researchers to draw more informative conclusions about null-effects.},

Whilst LMMs offer a flexible approach to modelling a broad range of data types, ecological data are often complex and require complex model structures, and the fitting and interpretation of such models is not always straightforward. The ability to achieve robust biological inference requires that practitioners know how and when to apply these tools. Here, we provide a general overview of current methods for the application of LMMs to biological data, and highlight the typical pitfalls that can be encountered in the statistical modelling process. We tackle several issues regarding methods of model selection, with particular reference to the use of information theory and multi-model inference in ecology. We offer practical solutions and direct the reader to key references that provide further technical detail for those seeking a deeper understanding. This overview should serve as a widely accessible code of best practice for applying LMMs to complex biological problems and model structures, and in doing so improve the robustness of conclusions drawn from studies investigating ecological and evolutionary questions.},

Further, we test Williams's (2009) proposition that the immediate impact of ostracism is resistant to moderation, but that moderation is more likely to be observed in delayed measures. Our findings suggest that (3) both first and last measures are susceptible to moderation and (4) time passed since being ostracized does not predict effect sizes of the last measure. Thus, support for this proposition is tenuous and we suggest modifications to the temporal need-threat model of ostracism.},

psychological theory that predicted the phenomena. In this paper we present a template for theory evaluation
suited for the class of theories produced by psychological science: Theories of construction. As a case study,
we perform a rigorous post-publication peer-review of the theoretical core of Unconscious Thought Theory
(UTT). We present several uncomplicated indices that quantify the quality of evaluation of the results and
conclusions by experts who reviewed the article and the amount of interpretation bias on behalf of the
authors. The results reveal a failure of expert peer-review to detect empirical reports of sub-standard quality.
The analyses reveal there is in fact hardly any empirical evidence for the predictions of UTT in important
papers that claim its support. Our advice is to evaluate before you replicate.

The derivation of the procedure is based on a constrained optimization problem that maximizes a general form of a ratio of expected mean squares subject to a budget constraint. The procedure makes use of variance component estimates to optimize designs during the budget formulating stages. The method provides more general closed form solutions than other currently available formulae. As such, the proposed procedure allows for the determination of the optimal numbers of units for studies that involve more complex designs. A method is also described for optimizing designs when variance component estimates are not available. Case studies are provided to demonstrate the method.},

  abstract = {The concept of intrinsic credibility has been recently introduced to check the credibility of `out of the blue' findings without any prior support. A significant result is deemed intrinsically credible if it is in conflict with a sceptical prior derived from the very same data that would make the effect just non-significant. In this paper, I propose to use Bayesian prior-predictive tail probabilities to assess intrinsic credibility. For the standard 5\% significance level, this leads to a new p-value threshold that is remarkably close to the recently proposed p {$<$} 0.005 standard. I also introduce the credibility ratio, the ratio of the upper to the lower limit (or vice versa) of a confidence interval for a significant effect size. I show that the credibility ratio has to be smaller than 5.8 such that a significant finding is also intrinsically credible. Finally, a p-value for intrinsic credibility is proposed that is a simple function of the ordinary p-value and has a direct frequentist interpretation in terms of the probability of replicating an effect. An application to data from the Open Science Collaboration study on the reproducibility of psychological science suggests that intrinsic credibility of the original experiment is better suited to predict the success of a replication experiment than standard significance.},

Furthermore, the question of whether mimicry leads to emotional contagion and in turn facilitates emotion recognition was addressed. Forty-one female participants rated a series of short video clips of stimulus persons expressing anger, sadness, disgust, and happiness regarding the emotions expressed. An unobtrusive measure of emotional contagion was taken. Evidence for mimicry was found for all types of expressions. Furthermore, evidence for emotional contagion of happiness and sadness was found. Mediational analyses could not confirm any relation between mimicry and emotional contagion nor between mimicry and emotion recognition. á®Š 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

The aim of this paper is to contribute to the understanding of the coordinating efforts of intermediary organizations. Starting from the definition of coordination as the establishment or strengthening of a relationship among the activities in a system, with the aim to enhance their common effectiveness, I develop a heuristic framework that facilitates the systematic analysis of coordination in science. I illustrate and substantiate my framework with the empirical case study of a Dutch coordination task force in the area of chemical technologies. Thanks to the framework I could disentangle a number of functions that this task force fulfils concerning research programming, funding allocation and supporting interactions and collaborations. This approach enabled me to systematically analyse a very heterogeneous set of processes that each deserve to be called coordination. The analysis yields a clear overview of eight coordination processes that are each described in terms of activities, intervention, relationships, mechanisms and performance. I conclude my paper with suggestions for further research on coordination in the science system.},

When meta-analyses are updated account should be taken of the possibility of false-positive findings due to repeated significance tests. We discuss the use of sequential methods for meta-analyses that incorporate random effects to allow for heterogeneity across studies. We propose a method that uses an approximate semi-Bayes procedure to update evidence on the among-study variance, starting with an informative prior distribution that might be based on findings from previous meta-analyses. We compare our methods with other approaches, including the traditional method of cumulative meta-analysis, in a simulation study and observe that it has Type I and Type II error rates close to the nominal level. We illustrate the method using an example in the treatment of bleeding peptic ulcers. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Instead, one must develop empirical benchmarks of comparison that reflect the nature of the intervention being evaluated, its target population, and the outcome measure or measures being used. This approach is applied to the assessment of effect size measures for educational interventions designed to improve student academic achievement. Three types of empirical benchmarks are illustrated: (a) normative expectations for growth over time in student achievement, (b) policy-relevant gaps in student achievement by demographic group or school performance, and (c) effect size results from past research for similar interventions and target populations. The findings can be used to help assess educational interventions, and the process of doing so can provide guidelines for how to develop and use such benchmarks in other fields.},

  abstract = {Null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) is undoubtedly the most common inferential technique used to justify claims in the social sciences. However, even staunch defenders of NHST agree that its outcomes are often misinterpreted. Confidence intervals (CIs) have frequently been proposed as a more useful alternative to NHST, and their use is strongly encouraged in the APA Manual. Nevertheless, little is known about how researchers interpret CIs. In this study, 120 researchers and 442 students-all in the field of psychology-were asked to assess the truth value of six particular statements involving different interpretations of a CI. Although all six statements were false, both researchers and students endorsed, on average, more than three statements, indicating a gross misunderstanding of CIs. Self-declared experience with statistics was not related to researchers' performance, and, even more surprisingly, researchers hardly outperformed the students, even though the students had not received any education on statistical inference whatsoever. Our findings suggest that many researchers do not know the correct interpretation of a CI. The misunderstandings surrounding p-values and CIs are particularly unfortunate because they constitute the main tools by which psychologists draw conclusions from data.},

To investigate desire and attempts to control desire in everyday life, we conducted a large-scale experience sampling study based on a conceptual framework integrating desire strength, conflict, resistance (use of self-control), and behavior enactment. A sample of 205 adults wore beepers for a week. They furnished 7,827 reports of desire episodes and completed personality measures of behavioral inhibition system/behavior activation system (BIS/BAS) sensitivity, trait self-control, perfectionism, and narcissistic entitlement. Results suggest that desires are frequent, variable in intensity, and largely unproblematic. Those urges that do conflict with other goals tend to elicit resistance, with uneven success. Desire strength, conflict, resistance, and self-regulatory success were moderated in multiple ways by personality variables as well as by situational and interpersonal factors such as alcohol consumption, the mere presence of others, and the presence of others who already had enacted the desire in question. Whereas personality generally had a stronger impact on the dimensions of desire that emerged early in its course (desire strength and conflict), situational factors showed relatively more influence on components later in the process (resistance and behavior enactment). In total, these findings offer a novel and detailed perspective on the nature of everyday desires and associated self-regulatory successes and failures.},

On the perceptual side, the dominant cognitive view largely underestimates, and thus fails to account for, the impact of action-related processes on both the processing of perceptual information and on perceptual learning. On the action side, most approaches conceive of action planning as a mere continuation of stimulus processing, thus failing to account for the goal-directedness of even the simplest reaction in an experimental task. We propose a new framework for a more adequate theoretical treatment of perception and action planning, in which perceptual contents and action plans are coded in a common representational medium by feature codes with distal reference. Perceived events (perceptions) and to-be-produced events (actions) are equally represented by integrated, task-tuned networks of feature codes \textendash{} cognitive structures we call event codes. We give an overview of evidence from a wide variety of empirical domains, such as spatial stimulus-response compatibility, sensorimotor synchronization, and ideomotor action, showing that our main assumptions are well supported by the data.},

Using data from comparable surveys of academic scientists in three fields (experimental biology, mathematics, and physics), we test whether scientists have become more competitive and more secretive over the last 30 years. We also use the recent survey to test a multivariate model of the effects of scientific competition and commercialization (patenting, industry funding, and industry collaboration) on scientific secrecy. We find that secrecy has increased, and has increased particularly for experimental biologists. Only 13 percent of experimental biologists in 1998 felt safe discussing their ongoing research with all others doing similar work. Our multivariate analysis shows that this secrecy is most related to concerns about being anticipated (scientific competition). We find that patenting is associated with increased secrecy among mathematicians and physicists, but not for experimental biologists. We find that industry funding is associated with more secrecy, while industry collaboration is associated with less secrecy, across fields. Our results suggest that the recent concern over increasing scientific secrecy has merit. However, this increased secrecy seems to result from a combination of increasing commercial linkages and increased pressures from scientific competition. Our research highlights the central role that scientists' competition for priority plays in the system of science and that, while such competition spurs effort, it also produces negative effects that recent trends toward commercialization of academic science seem to be exacerbating.},

  abstract = {BackgroundStatistical methods for inferring the true magnitude of an effect from a sample should have acceptable error rates when the true effect is trivial (type I rates) or substantial (type II rates).ObjectiveThe objective of this study was to quantify the error rates, rates of decisive (publishable) outcomes and publication bias of five inferential methods commonly used in sports medicine and science. The methods were conventional null-hypothesis significance testing [NHST] (significant and non-significant imply substantial and trivial true effects, respectively); conservative NHST (the observed magnitude is interpreted as the true magnitude only for significant effects); non-clinical magnitude-based inference [MBI] (the true magnitude is interpreted as the magnitude range of the 90 \% confidence interval only for intervals not spanning substantial values of the opposite sign); clinical MBI (a possibly beneficial effect is recommended for implementation only if it is most unlikely to be harmful); and odds-ratio clinical MBI (implementation is also recommended when the odds of benefit outweigh the odds of harm, with an odds ratio {$>$}66).MethodsSimulation was used to quantify standardized mean effects in 500,000 randomized, controlled trials each for true standardized magnitudes ranging from null through marginally moderate with three sample sizes: suboptimal (10 + 10), optimal for MBI (50 + 50) and optimal for NHST (144 + 144).ResultsType I rates for non-clinical MBI were always lower than for NHST. When type I rates for clinical MBI were higher, most errors were debatable, given the probabilistic qualification of those inferences (unlikely or possibly beneficial). NHST often had unacceptable rates for either type II errors or decisive outcomes, and it had substantial publication bias with the smallest sample size, whereas MBI had no such problems.ConclusionMBI is a trustworthy, nuanced alternative to NHST, which it outperforms in terms of the sample size, error rates, decision rates and publication bias.},

  abstract = {The information theory developed by Shannon was designed to place a quantitative measure on the amount of information involved in any communication. The early developers stressed that the information measure was dependent only on the probabilistic structure of the communication process. For example, if losing all your assets in the stock market and having whale steak for supper have the same probability, then the information associated with the occurrence of either event is the same. Attempts to apply Shannon's information theory to problems beyond communications have, in the large, come to grief. The failure of these attempts could have been predicted because no theory that involves just the probabilities of outcomes without considering their consequences could possibly be adequate in describing the importance of uncertainty to a decision maker. It is necessary to be concerned not only with the probabilistic nature of the uncertainties that surround us, but also with the economic impact that these uncertainties will have on us. In this paper the theory of the value of information that arises from considering jointly the probabilistic and economic factors that affect decisions is discussed and illustrated. It is found that numerical values can be assigned to the elimination or reduction of any uncertainty. Furthermore, it is seen that the joint elimination of the uncertainty about a number of even independent factors in a problem can have a value that differs from the sum of the values of eliminating the uncertainty in each factor separately.},

  abstract = {Several statistical methods have recently been developed that use the distribution of P-values from multiple tests of hypotheses to analyze data from high-dimensional experiments. These methods are only as valid as the P-values that were derived from test statistics. If an incorrect distribution for a test statistic was used, the P-value will not be valid and the distribution of P-values from multiple test statistics could give misleading results. Moreover, if the correct distribution of a test statistic is used, a distribution of P-values may still give misleading results if P-values are correlated. A primary focus of this paper is on the distribution of a P-value under a null hypothesis, and the test statistic that is considered is the number of rejected null hypotheses. Two issues are demonstrated using six data examples, two that are simulated and four from actual microarray experiments. The results provide some insight into how much of an effect might be introduced into a distribution of P-values if invalid P-values are computed or if P-values are correlated. Additional illustration is given regarding the distribution of a P-value under an alternative hypothesis and some approaches to modeling it are presented.},

  abstract = {Insufficient effort responding (IER; Huang, Curran, Keeney, Poposki, \& DeShon, 2012) to surveys has largely been assumed to be a source of random measurement error that attenuates associations between substantive measures. The current article, however, illustrates how and when the presence of IER can produce a systematic bias that inflates observed correlations between substantive measures. Noting that inattentive responses as a whole generally congregate around the midpoint of a Likert scale, we propose that Mattentive, defined as the mean score of attentive respondents on a substantive measure, will be negatively related to IER's confounding effect on substantive measures (i.e., correlations between IER and a given substantive measure will become less positive [or more negative] as Mattentive increases). Results from a personality questionnaire (Study 1) and a simulation (Study 2) consistently support the hypothesized confounding influence of IER. Using an employee sample (Study 3), we demonstrated how IER can confound bivariate relationships between substantive measures. Together, these studies indicate that IER can inflate the strength of observed relationships when scale means depart from the scale midpoints, resulting in an inflated Type I error rate. This challenges the traditional view that IER attenuates observed bivariate correlations. These findings highlight situations where IER may be a methodological nuisance, while underscoring the need for survey administrators and researchers to deter and detect IER in surveys. The current article serves as a wake-up call for researchers and practitioners to more closely examine IER in their data.},

But will they be successful? The present study offers compelling evidence that this will be an extraordinarily difficult task. Dramatic citation-count data on 25 articles and books severely critical of NHST's negative impact on good science, underlining that this issue was/is well known, did nothing to stem its usage over the period 1960\textendash 2007. On the contrary, employment of NHST increased during this time. To be successful in this endeavor, as well as restoring the relevance of the statistics profession to the scientific community in the 21st century, the ASA must be prepared to dispense detailed advice. This includes specifying those situations, if they can be identified, in which the p-value plays a clearly valuable role in data analysis and interpretation. The ASA might also consider a statement that recommends abandoning the use of p-values.},

For both sexes, ratings of opposite-sex voice attractiveness also predicted reported age of first sexual intercourse, number of sexual partners, number of extra-pair copulation (EPC) partners, and number of partners that they had intercourse with that were involved in another relationship (i.e., were themselves chosen as an EPC partner). Coupled with previous findings showing a relationship between voice attractiveness and bilateral symmetry, these results provide additional evidence that the sound of a person's voice may serve as an important multidimensional fitness indicator.},

  abstract = {POLICY POINTS: Currently, there is massive production of unnecessary, misleading, and conflicted systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Instead of promoting evidence-based medicine and health care, these instruments often serve mostly as easily produced publishable units or marketing tools. Suboptimal systematic reviews and meta-analyses can be harmful given the major prestige and influence these types of studies have acquired. The publication of systematic reviews and meta-analyses should be realigned to remove biases and vested interests and to integrate them better with the primary production of evidence.
CONTEXT: Currently, most systematic reviews and meta-analyses are done retrospectively with fragmented published information. This article aims to explore the growth of published systematic reviews and meta-analyses and to estimate how often they are redundant, misleading, or serving conflicted interests.
METHODS: Data included information from PubMed surveys and from empirical evaluations of meta-analyses.
FINDINGS: Publication of systematic reviews and meta-analyses has increased rapidly. In the period January 1, 1986, to December 4, 2015, PubMed tags 266,782 items as "systematic reviews" and 58,611 as "meta-analyses." Annual publications between 1991 and 2014 increased 2,728\% for systematic reviews and 2,635\% for meta-analyses versus only 153\% for all PubMed-indexed items. Currently, probably more systematic reviews of trials than new randomized trials are published annually. Most topics addressed by meta-analyses of randomized trials have overlapping, redundant meta-analyses; same-topic meta-analyses may exceed 20 sometimes. Some fields produce massive numbers of meta-analyses; for example, 185 meta-analyses of antidepressants for depression were published between 2007 and 2014. These meta-analyses are often produced either by industry employees or by authors with industry ties and results are aligned with sponsor interests. China has rapidly become the most prolific producer of English-language, PubMed-indexed meta-analyses. The most massive presence of Chinese meta-analyses is on genetic associations (63\% of global production in 2014), where almost all results are misleading since they combine fragmented information from mostly abandoned era of candidate genes. Furthermore, many contracting companies working on evidence synthesis receive industry contracts to produce meta-analyses, many of which probably remain unpublished. Many other meta-analyses have serious flaws. Of the remaining, most have weak or insufficient evidence to inform decision making. Few systematic reviews and meta-analyses are both non-misleading and useful.
CONCLUSIONS: The production of systematic reviews and meta-analyses has reached epidemic proportions. Possibly, the large majority of produced systematic reviews and meta-analyses are unnecessary, misleading, and/or conflicted.},

  abstract = {Systematic reviews and meta-analyses have reached a critical point. Their success is solid and dreadful at the same time. They are widely considered the highest level of evidence. There are tens of thousands of systematic reviews already published, but their production is still increasing geometrically. The problem is that the majority of systematic reviews are flawed, misleading, redundant, useless or all of the above,1 and this applies to almost all medical fields, including sports and exercise medicine.

Part of the problem with systematic reviews stems from the poor, misleading primary evidence2 that authors try to synthesise and make sense of. However, if this were the only major problem, systematic reviews and meta-analyses would still be extremely useful. They could focus exactly on showing how flawed, misleading and useless this evidence is. This could lead to suggestions on how to improve research in the field. Instead, systematic reviews often sanctify results from poor studies, by making these seem even more statistically significant and (spuriously) conclusive. They can also compound the problems seen in the primary studies, if they are driven by reviewers and sponsors with conflicts of interest, financial or academic.

There are four types of `next-generation' systematic reviews that may raise the bar and help shape a new generation of more reliable evidence synthesis: prospective meta-analysis, individual-level data, network meta-analyses and umbrella reviews. They are not necessarily brand new ideas, but in the current circumstances of uncontrollable overproduction and unchecked quality, they have a fresh opportunity for impact. This large-scale impact would have been unimaginable in the past due to constrains in access to data, limited availability of sophisticated methods and fewer opportunities for their application. None of these next-generation tools are bullet proof, but they hold promise and some distinct advantages. Their disadvantages also need to be \ldots},

  abstract = {Meeting a crucial need for graduate students and newly minted researchers, this innovative text provides hands-on tools for generating ideas and translating them into formal theories. It is illustrated with numerous practical examples drawn from multiple social science disciplines and research settings. The authors offer clear guidance for defining constructs, thinking through relationships and processes that link constructs, and deriving new theoretical models (or building on existing ones) based on those relationships. Step by step, they show readers how to use causal analysis, mathematical modeling, simulations, and grounded and emergent approaches to theory construction. A chapter on writing about theories contains invaluable advice on crafting effective papers and grant applications. Useful pedagogical features in every chapter include:  Application exercises and concept exercises Lists of key terms and engaging topical boxes Annotated suggestions for further reading. This book is intended for graduate students in a range of disciplines, including psychology, education, sociology, health, and management, as well as social scientists pursing research careers in academic or other settings. It can serve as a primary text in graduate-level courses in theory construction or as a supplemental text in courses on research methodology, theories of a particular discipline, grant writing, or the dissertation.},

  abstract = {Students frequently engage in note-taking to improve the amount of information they remember from lectures. One beneficial effect of note-taking is known as the encoding effect, which refers to deeper processing of information as a consequence of taking notes. This review consists of two parts. In the first part, four lines of research on the encoding effect are summarized: 1) manipulation of the lecture material, 2) manipulation of the method of note-taking, 3) the importance of individual differences, and 4) the testing procedure used in the empirical studies. This review highlights the fragmented nature of the current literature. In the second part of this review five forms of cognitive load that are induced by note-taking are distinguished. Cognitive load theory is used to integrate the divergent results in the literature. Based on the review, it is concluded that cognitive load theory provides a useful framework for future theory development and experimental work.},

  abstract = {Investigators from a large consortium of scientists recently performed a multi-year study in which they replicated 100 psychology experiments. Although statistically significant results were reported in 97\% of the original studies, statistical significance was achieved in only 36\% of the replicated studies. This article presents a reanalysis of these data based on a formal statistical model that accounts for publication bias by treating outcomes from unpublished studies as missing data, while simultaneously estimating the distribution of effect sizes for those studies that tested nonnull effects. The resulting model suggests that more than 90\% of tests performed in eligible psychology experiments tested negligible effects, and that publication biases based on p-values caused the observed rates of nonreproducibility. The results of this reanalysis provide a compelling argument for both increasing the threshold required for declaring scientific discoveries and for adopting statistical summaries of evidence that account for the high proportion of tested hypotheses that are false. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

  abstract = {To begin with, Neyman and Pearson agreed with Fisher that the result in a hypothesis test is a measure of evidence. In their first joint paper, which was published in 1928, they declared that the level of significance (P-level) attained in a likelihood ratio test is a measure of evidence against the null hypothesis [1928, pp.28\textendash 9], and that a hypothesis test is a method with which to ``accept'' or ``reject'' the null hypothesis ``..with a greater or less degree of confidence'' or certainty [1928, pp.1, 67]. This was clearly an inferential interpretation.1 However, in 1933, in their celebrated joint paper to the Royal Society, they introduced the notion that a hypothesis test is simply a ``rule of behavior'', i.e. a rule for decision between alternate courses of action. This was Neyman's idea. Pearson, it seems, retained the position that a hypothesis test is a legitimate method for inference. Indeed, in a paper of his own published in 1955, Pearson agreed explicitly with Fisher that a test is a ``means for learning'' [1955, p.206]. Furthermore, in this same paper, he, disclaimed any association with Neyman's idea that tests are methods merely for ``inductive behavior'' or decision [1955, pp.206\textendash 7]. Moreover, there seems a commitment to inference throughout Pearson's writing. For example, consider his statement in a joint paper with Clopper [1934, pp.404\textendash 5] that some confidence interval (P1,P2) with ``confidence coefficient'' 1-{$\alpha$} entails a degree of confidence or certainty (probability-,)2 of 1-{$\alpha$} that the true paramater \texttheta{} lies in the interval p 1 to p 2 , i.e. prob 1(\texttheta{$\smallin$} (p 1,p 2)=1-{$\alpha$}.},

Since the test of the null hypothesis against a one-sided alternative is the most powerful test for all directional hypotheses, it is strongly recommended that the one-tailed model be adopted wherever its use is appropriate."

Participants provided judgments of importance while they held either a heavy or a light clipboard. Holding a heavy clipboard increased judgments of monetary value (Study 1) and made participants consider fair decision-making procedures to be more important (Study 2). It also caused more elaborate thinking, as indicated by higher consistency between related judgments (Study 3) and by greater polarization of agreement ratings for strong versus weak arguments (Study 4). In line with an embodied perspective on cognition, these findings suggest that, much as weight makes people invest more physical effort in dealing with concrete objects, it also makes people invest more cognitive effort in dealing with abstract issues.},

Moreover, this approach opens up further avenues for philosophical inquiry and has important implications for philosophical debates concerning inductive risk.

  abstract = {Background We explore whether the number of null results in large National Heart Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) funded trials has increased over time.   Methods We identified all large NHLBI supported RCTs between 1970 and 2012 evaluating drugs or dietary supplements for the treatment or prevention of cardiovascular disease. Trials were included if direct costs {$>\$$}500,000/year, participants were adult humans, and the primary outcome was cardiovascular risk, disease or death. The 55 trials meeting these criteria were coded for whether they were published prior to or after the year 2000, whether they registered in clinicaltrials.gov prior to publication, used active or placebo comparator, and whether or not the trial had industry co-sponsorship. We tabulated whether the study reported a positive, negative, or null result on the primary outcome variable and for total mortality.   Results 17 of 30 studies (57\%) published prior to 2000 showed a significant benefit of intervention on the primary outcome in comparison to only 2 among the 25 (8\%) trials published after 2000 ({$\chi$}2=12.2,df= 1, p=0.0005). There has been no change in the proportion of trials that compared treatment to placebo versus active comparator. Industry co-sponsorship was unrelated to the probability of reporting a significant benefit. Pre-registration in clinical trials.gov was strongly associated with the trend toward null findings.   Conclusions The number NHLBI trials reporting positive results declined after the year 2000. Prospective declaration of outcomes in RCTs, and the adoption of transparent reporting standards, as required by clinicaltrials.gov, may have contributed to the trend toward null findings.},

To answer this question, we consider current debates regarding replication through the lenses of creativity research and theory. Both scientific work and creativity require striking a balance between ideation and implementation and between freedom and constraints. However, current debates about replication and some of the emerging guidelines stemming from them threaten this balance and run the risk of stifling innovation. Although we recognize the importance of doing rigorous science, we argue that any ``one size fits all'' research guidelines being proposed or enforced will do more harm than good for scientific creativity.},

Faculty included Richard Keefe, PhD; James McNulty, AbScB; Robert S. Epstein, MD, MS; Shelby D. Reed, PhD; Juan Sanchez, MD; Ginger Haynes, PhD; Andrew C. Leon, PhD; Helena Chmura Kraemer, PhD; Ellen Frank, PhD, and Kenneth L. Davis, MD., Results: The term clinically meaningful effect is an important aspect of designing and interpreting randomized controlled trials but can be particularly difficult in the setting of psychopharmacology where effect size may be modest, particularly over the short term, because of a strong response to placebo. Payers, regulators, patients, and clinicians have different concerns about clinically meaningful effects and may describe these terms differently. The use of moderators in success rate differences may help better delineate clinically meaningful effects., Conclusion: There is no clear consensus on a single definition for clinically meaningful differences in randomized controlled trials, and investigators must be sensitive to specific concerns of stakeholders in psychopharmacology in order to design and execute appropriate clinical trials.},

This book describes how a confused decision maker, who wishes to make a reasonable and responsible choice among alternatives, can systematically probe his true feelings in order to make those critically important, vexing trade-offs between incommensurable objectives. The theory is illustrated by many real concrete examples taken from a host of disciplinary settings. The standard approach in decision theory or decision analysis specifies a simplified single objective like monetary return to maximise. By generalising from the single objective case to the multiple objective case, this book considerably widens the range of applicability of decision analysis.},

In sequential estimation the sample size to use is not specified at the start of the study, and instead study outcomes are used to evaluate a predefined stopping rule, if sampling should continue or stop. In this article we develop a general theory for sequential estimation procedure for constructing a narrow confidence interval for a general class of effect sizes with a specified level of confidence (e.g., 95\%) and a specified upper bound on the confidence interval width. Our method does not require prespecified, yet usually unknowable, population values of certain parameters for certain types of distributions, thus offering advantages compared to commonly used approaches to sample size planning. Importantly, we make our developments in a distribution-free environment and thus do not make untenable assumptions about the population from which observations are sampled. Our work is thus very general, timely due to the interest in effect sizes, and has wide applicability in the context of estimation of a general class of effect sizes.},

  abstract = {The behavioral, educational, and social sciences are undergoing a paradigmatic shift in methodology, from disciplines that focus on the dichotomous outcome of null hypothesis significance tests to disciplines that report and interpret effect sizes and their corresponding confidence intervals. Due to the arbitrariness of many measurement instruments used in the behavioral, educational, and social sciences, some of the most widely reported effect sizes are standardized. Although forming confidence intervals for standardized effect sizes can be very beneficial, such confidence interval procedures are generally difficult to implement because they depend on noncentral t, F , and {$\chi$}2 distributions. At present, no main-stream statistical package provides exact confidence intervals for standardized effects without the use of specialized programming scripts. Methods for the Behavioral, Educational, and Social Sciences (MBESS) is an R package that has routines for calculating confidence intervals for noncentral t, F , and {$\chi$}2 distributions, which are then used in the calculation of exact confidence intervals for standardized effect sizes by using the confidence interval transformation and inversion principles. The present article discusses the way in which confidence intervals are formed for standardized effect sizes and illustrates how such confidence intervals can be easily formed using MBESS in R.},

On presentation to the ED, patients marked the level of their pain on a 100 mm, non-hatched VAS scale. At 20 minute intervals thereafter they were asked to give a verbal categorical rating of their pain as "a lot better", "a little better", "much the same", "a little worse" or "much worse" and to mark the level of pain on a VAS scale of the same type as used previously. It was pre-defined that patients with VAS pain scores of 30 mm or less would be categorised as having mild pain, those with scores of 70 mm or more were categorised as having severe pain and those from 31 mm to 69 mm, moderate pain. The minimal clinically significant difference (MCSD) in VAS pain score was defined as the mean difference between current and preceding scores when the subject reported "a little worse" or "a little better" pain. , Results\textemdash 156 patients were enrolled in the study, yielding 88 evaluable comparisons where pain was rated as "a little better" or "a little worse". The MCSD in VAS score in the group overall was 12 mm (95\%CI 9 mm to 15 mm). MCSD in VAS score for the "mild pain" group was 11 mm (95\%CI 4 mm to 18 mm), for the "moderate pain" group 14 mm (95\%CI 10 mm to 18 mm) and for the severe pain group, 10 mm (95\%CI 6 mm to 14 mm). There is no statistical difference between the MCSD in VAS score between the severity groups. , Conclusions\textemdash The MCSD in VAS pain score does not differ with the severity of pain being experienced.},

For construct validity, particularly the psychological meaning of measures, multivariate models that treat measures from both overtime and dyadic data as being a combination of multiple constructs are discussed. For conclusion validity or valid statistical inference, the problem of low power when generalizability is high and the assumption of independence are discussed. Finding the truth in psychological research is a challenge, and seemingly insurmountable difficulties are often encountered. Nonetheless, persistent and diligent efforts using strategies developed by generations of methodologists should lead to scientific advancement.

Public Significance Statement\textemdash For psychological research to be applied, its conclusions must be true. Donald T. Campbell and colleagues developed four different ways to assess the validity of scientific research. In this article, I discuss work done by myself and my colleagues on enhancing these four different types of validity. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)},

HARKing is defined as presenting a post hoc hypothesis (i.e., one based on or informed by one's results) in one's research report as if it were, in fact, an a priori hypotheses. Several forms of HARKing are identified and survey data are presented that suggests that at least some forms of HARKing are widely practiced and widely seen as inappropriate. I identify several reasons why scientists might HARK. Then I discuss several reasons why scientists ought not to HARK. It is conceded that the question of whether HARKing's costs exceed its benefits is a complex one that ought to be addressed through research, open discussion, and debate. To help stimulate such discussion (and for those such as myself who suspect that HARKing's costs do exceed its benefits), I conclude the article with some suggestions for deterring HARKing.},

If a man believes something for a reason which is preposterous or for no reason at all, and what he believes turns out to be true for some reason not known to him, he cannot be said to believe it rationally, although he believes it and it is in fact true. On the other hand, a man may rationally believe a proposition to be probable, when it is in fact false. -from Chapter II: Probability in Relation to the Theory of Knowledge His fame as an economist aside, John Maynard Keynes may be best remembered for saying, In the long run, we are all dead. That phrase may well be the most succinct expression of the theory of probability every uttered. For a longer explanation of the premise that underlies much of modern mathematics and science, Keynes's A Treatise on Probability is essential reading. First published in 1920, this is the foundational work of probability theory, which helped establish the author's enormous influence on modern economic and even political theories. Exploring aspects of randomness and chance, inductive reasoning and logical statistics, this is a work that belongs in the library of any interested in numbers and their application in the real world.

Theory of Mind is the human capacity to comprehend that other people hold beliefs and desires and that these may differ from one's own beliefs and desires. The currently predominant view is that literary fiction\textemdash often described as narratives that focus on in-depth portrayals of subjects' inner feelings and thoughts\textemdash can be linked to theory of mind processes, especially those that are involved in the understanding or simulation of the affective characteristics of the subjects. Kidd and Castano (p. 377, published online 3 October) provide experimental evidence that reading passages of literary fiction, in comparison to nonfiction or popular fiction, does indeed enhance the reader's performance on theory of mind tasks.
Understanding others' mental states is a crucial skill that enables the complex social relationships that characterize human societies. Yet little research has investigated what fosters this skill, which is known as Theory of Mind (ToM), in adults. We present five experiments showing that reading literary fiction led to better performance on tests of affective ToM (experiments 1 to 5) and cognitive ToM (experiments 4 and 5) compared with reading nonfiction (experiments 1), popular fiction (experiments 2 to 5), or nothing at all (experiments 2 and 5). Specifically, these results show that reading literary fiction temporarily enhances ToM. More broadly, they suggest that ToM may be influenced by engagement with works of art.
Experimental evidence suggests that reading good fiction helps us to understand others.

The best way to test reliability is to predict an effect before it occurs. If we can manipulate the independent variables (the efficient causes) that make it occur, then ability to predict makes it possible to control. Such control helps to isolate the relevant variables. Control also refers to a comparison condition, conducted to see what would have happened if we had not deployed the key ingredient of the hypothesis: scientific knowledge only accrues when we compare what happens in one condition against what happens in another. When the results of such comparisons are not definitive, metrics of the degree of efficacy of the manipulation are required. Many of those derive from statistical inference, and many of those poorly serve the purpose of the cumulation of knowledge. Without ability to replicate an effect, the utility of the principle used to predict or control is dubious. Traditional models of statistical inference are weak guides to replicability and utility of results. Several alternatives to null hypothesis testing are sketched: Bayesian, model comparison, and predictive inference (prep). Predictive inference shows, for example, that the failure to replicate most results in the Open Science Project was predictable. Replicability is but one aspect of scientific understanding: it establishes the reliability of our data and the predictive ability of our formal models. It is a necessary aspect of scientific progress, even if not by itself sufficient for understanding.},

  abstract = {The minimal important difference (MID) is a phrase with instant appeal in a field struggling to interpret health-related quality of life and other patient-reported outcomes. The terminology can be confusing, with several terms differing only slightly in definition (e.g., minimal clinically important difference, clinically important difference, minimally detectable difference, the subjectively significant difference), and others that seem similar despite having quite different meanings (minimally detectable difference versus minimum detectable change). Often, nuances of definition are of little consequence in the way that these quantities are estimated and used. Four methods are commonly employed to estimate MIDs: patient rating of change (global transition items); clinical anchors; standard error of measurement; and effect size. These are described and critiqued in this article. There is no universal MID, despite the appeal of the notion. Indeed, for a particular patient-reported outcome instrument or scale, the MID is not an immutable characteristic, but may vary by population and context. At both the group and individual level, the MID may depend on the clinical context and decision at hand, the baseline from which the patient starts, and whether they are improving or deteriorating. Specific estimates of MIDs should therefore not be overinterpreted. For a given health-related quality-of-life scale, all available MID estimates (and their confidence intervals) should be considered, amalgamated into general guidelines and applied judiciously to any particular clinical or research context.},

I explore the ways in which the actual situation fails to live up to this ideal. Our investigations are not always directed towards the questions of most concern to most people, the results on which experts agree are not always based on reasons the broader public is prepared to endorse, and the dissemination of information is so distorted as to make supposedly free discussion and debate an unproductive shouting match. The consequences for democracy are severe, since a healthy system of public knowledge, able to discharge its function, is an essential component of a flourishing democratic society.},

  abstract = {We conducted preregistered replications of 28 classic and contemporary published findings, with protocols that were peer reviewed in advance, to examine variation in effect magnitudes across samples and settings. Each protocol was administered to approximately half of 125 samples that comprised 15,305 participants from 36 countries and territories. Using the conventional criterion of statistical significance (p {$<$} .05), we found that 15 (54\%) of the replications provided evidence of a statistically significant effect in the same direction as the original finding. With a strict significance criterion (p {$<$} .0001), 14 (50\%) of the replications still provided such evidence, a reflection of the extremely high-powered design. Seven (25\%) of the replications yielded effect sizes larger than the original ones, and 21 (75\%) yielded effect sizes smaller than the original ones. The median comparable Cohen's ds were 0.60 for the original findings and 0.15 for the replications. The effect sizes were small ({$<$} 0.20) in 16 of the replications (57\%), and 9 effects (32\%) were in the direction opposite the direction of the original effect. Across settings, the Q statistic indicated significant heterogeneity in 11 (39\%) of the replication effects, and most of those were among the findings with the largest overall effect sizes; only 1 effect that was near zero in the aggregate showed significant heterogeneity according to this measure. Only 1 effect had a tau value greater than .20, an indication of moderate heterogeneity. Eight others had tau values near or slightly above .10, an indication of slight heterogeneity. Moderation tests indicated that very little heterogeneity was attributable to the order in which the tasks were performed or whether the tasks were administered in lab versus online. Exploratory comparisons revealed little heterogeneity between Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic (WEIRD) cultures and less WEIRD cultures (i.e., cultures with relatively high and low WEIRDness scores, respectively). Cumulatively, variability in the observed effect sizes was attributable more to the effect being studied than to the sample or setting in which it was studied.},

  abstract = {Little is known about the longitudinal relationship of hopelessness to attempted suicide in psychotic disorders. The present study addresses this gap by assessing hopelessness and attempted suicide at multiple time-points over 10-years in a first-admission cohort with psychosis (n=414). Approximately 1 in 5 participants attempted suicide during the 10-year follow-up, and those who attempted suicide scored significantly higher at baseline on the Beck Hopelessness Scale. In general, a given assessment of hopelessness (i.e., baseline, 6-months, 24-months, and 48-months) reliably predicted attempted suicide up to 4\textendash 6 years later, but not beyond. Structural equation modeling indicated that hopelessness prospectively predicted attempted suicide even when controlling for previous attempts. Notably, a cut-point of 3 or greater on the Beck Hopelessness Scale yielded sensitivity and specificity values similar to those found in non-psychotic populations using a cut-point of 9. Results suggest that hopelessness in individuals with psychotic disorders confers information about suicide risk above and beyond history of attempted suicide. Moreover, in comparison to non-psychotic populations, even relatively modest levels of hopelessness appear to confer risk for suicide in psychotic disorders.},

This paper explores academics' and undergraduates' usage of Twitter within a post-92 university. It argues that the observed disparity of usage between academics and undergraduates can be attributed to a number of factors. Namely, academics' perceived use of the platform for enhancing reputation is an implied acknowledgement of the importance of research within HE and the increasingly public engagement agenda. Additionally, academics' limited usage of Twitter to support practical-based issues may be explained by issues relating to accountability of information through non-official channels. Moreover, students made greater use of Twitter for the passive reception of information rather than participation in learning activities. The implications of these issues will be discussed in reference to the study findings.},

  abstract = {Although replications are vital to scientific progress, psychologists rarely engage in systematic replication efforts. In this article, we consider psychologists' narrative approach to scientific publications as an underlying reason for this neglect and propose an incentive structure for replications within psychology. First, researchers need accessible outlets for publishing replications. To accomplish this, psychology journals could publish replication reports in files that are electronically linked to reports of the original research. Second, replications should get cited. This can be achieved by cociting replications along with original research reports. Third, replications should become a valued collaborative effort. This can be realized by incorporating replications in teaching programs and by stimulating adversarial collaborations. The proposed incentive structure for replications can be developed in a relatively simple and cost-effective manner. By promoting replications, this incentive structure may greatly enhance the dependability of psychology's knowledge base.},

Emotional contagion is well established in laboratory experiments, with people transferring positive and negative emotions to others. Data from a large real-world social network, collected over a 20-y period suggests that longer-lasting moods (e.g., depression, happiness) can be transferred through networks [Fowler JH, Christakis NA (2008) BMJ 337:a2338], although the results are controversial. In an experiment with people who use Facebook, we test whether emotional contagion occurs outside of in-person interaction between individuals by reducing the amount of emotional content in the News Feed. When positive expressions were reduced, people produced fewer positive posts and more negative posts; when negative expressions were reduced, the opposite pattern occurred. These results indicate that emotions expressed by others on Facebook influence our own emotions, constituting experimental evidence for massive-scale contagion via social networks. This work also suggests that, in contrast to prevailing assumptions, in-person interaction and nonverbal cues are not strictly necessary for emotional contagion, and that the observation of others' positive experiences constitutes a positive experience for people.},

  abstract = {In this project I investigate the use and possible misuse of p values in papers published in five (high-ranked) journals in experimental psychology. I use a data set of over 135'000 p values from more than five thousand papers. I inspect (1) the way in which the p values are reported and (2) their distribution. The main findings are following: first, it appears that some authors choose the mode of reporting their results in an arbitrary way. Moreover, they often end up doing it in such a way that makes their findings seem more statistically significant than they really are (which is well known to improve the chances for publication). Specifically, they frequently report p values ``just above'' significance thresholds directly, whereas other values are reported by means of inequalities (e.g. ``p{$<$}.1''), they round the p values down more eagerly than up and appear to choose between the significance thresholds and between one- and two-sided tests only after seeing the data. Further, about 9.2\% of reported p values are inconsistent with their underlying statistics (e.g. F or t) and it appears that there are ``too many'' ``just significant'' values. One interpretation of this is that researchers tend to choose the model or include/discard observations to bring the p value to the right side of the threshold.},

Included are step-by-step instructions on how to carry out Bayesian data analyses in the popular and free software R and WinBugs, as well as new programs in JAGS and Stan. The new programs are designed to be much easier to use than the scripts in the first edition. In particular, there are now compact high-level scripts that make it easy to run the programs on your own data sets. The book is divided into three parts and begins with the basics: models, probability, Bayes' rule, and the R programming language. The discussion then moves to the fundamentals applied to inferring a binomial probability, before concluding with chapters on the generalized linear model. Topics include metric-predicted variable on one or two groups; metric-predicted variable with one metric predictor; metric-predicted variable with multiple metric predictors; metric-predicted variable with one nominal predictor; and metric-predicted variable with multiple nominal predictors. The exercises found in the text have explicit purposes and guidelines for accomplishment.

  abstract = {Data analysis in psychopathology research typically entails multiple stages of data preprocessing (e.g., coding of physiological measures), statistical decisions (e.g., inclusion of covariates), and reporting (e.g., selecting which variables best answer the research questions). The complexity and lack of transparency of these procedures have resulted in two troubling trends: the central hypotheses and analytical approaches are often selected after observing the data, and the research data are often not properly indexed. These practices are particularly problematic for (experimental) psychopathology research because the data are often hard to gather due to the target populations (e.g., individuals with mental disorders), and because the standard methodological approaches are challenging and time consuming (e.g., longitudinal studies). Here, we present a workflow that covers study preregistration, data anonymization, and the easy sharing of data and experimental material with the rest of the research community. This workflow is tailored to both original studies and secondary statistical analyses of archival data sets. In order to facilitate the implementation of the described workflow, we have developed a free and open-source software program. We argue that this workflow will result in more transparent and easily shareable psychopathology research, eventually increasing and replicability reproducibility in our research field.

The glue between the two appears to be the instrumentalist methodology, rather than that of the falsificationalist.  The instrumentalist methodology, used in the separate, comparative evaluation of theories in terms of their successes and problems (hence, even if already falsified), provides in theory and practice the straight road to short-term empirical progress in science ( \`a la Laudan). It is also argued that such progress is also functional for all kinds of truth approximation: observational, referential, and theoretical. This sheds new light on the long-term dynamics of science and hence on the relation between the main epistemological positions, viz., instrumentalism (Toulmin, Laudan), constructive empiricism (Van Fraassen), referential realism (Hacking, Cartwright), and theory realism of a non-essentialist nature (constructive realism \`a la Popper).  Readership: Open minded philosophers and scientists. The book explains and justifies the scientist's intuition that the debate among philosophers about instrumentalism and realism has almost no practical consequences.},

  abstract = {The qualitative theory of nomic truth approximation, presented in Kuipers in his (from instrumentalism to constructive realism, 2000), in which `the truth' concerns the distinction between nomic, e.g. physical, possibilities and impossibilities, rests on a very restrictive assumption, viz. that theories always claim to characterize the boundary between nomic possibilities and impossibilities. Fully recognizing two different functions of theories, viz. excluding and representing, this paper drops this assumption by conceiving theories in development as tuples of postulates and models, where the postulates claim to exclude nomic impossibilities and the (not-excluded) models claim to represent nomic possibilities. Revising theories becomes then a matter of adding or revising models and/or postulates in the light of increasing evidence, captured by a special kind of theories, viz. `data-theories'. Under the assumption that the data-theory is true, achieving empirical progress in this way provides good reasons for the abductive conclusion that truth approximation has been achieved as well. Here, the notions of truth approximation and empirical progress are formally direct generalizations of the earlier ones. However, truth approximation is now explicitly defined in terms of increasing truth-content and decreasing falsity-content of theories, whereas empirical progress is defined in terms of lasting increased accepted and decreased rejected content in the light of increasing evidence. These definitions are strongly inspired by a paper of Gustavo Cevolani, Vincenzo Crupi and Roberto Festa, viz., ``Verisimilitude and belief change for conjunctive theories'' (Cevolani et al. in Erkenntnis 75(2):183\textendash 222, 2011).},

  abstract = {Objective: To determine the clinical significance of changes in quality-of-life scores in patients with multiple myeloma (MM), we have estimated the minimal important difference (MID) for the health-related quality-of-life instrument, the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30. The MID is the smallest change in a quality-of-life score considered important to patients. Methods: Between 2006 and 2008, 239 patients with MM completed the EORTC QLQ-C30 at inclusion (T1) and after 3 months (T2). At T2, a structured quality-of-life interview was also performed. MIDs were calculated by using mean score changes (T2\textendash T1) for patients who in the interview stated they had improved, deteriorated or were unchanged. MIDs were also estimated by the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve method as well as by calculation effect sizes using standard deviations of baseline scores. Results: MIDs varied slightly depending on the method used. Patients stating in the interview that they had `improved' or `deteriorated' had a corresponding change in EORTC QLQ-C30 score ranging from 6 to15 (improvement) and from 9 to17 (deterioration) (scale range 0\textendash 100). The ROC analysis indicated that changes in score from 7 to17 represent clinically important changes to patients. The effect size method suggested 5\textendash 6 to be a small and 11\textendash 15 to be a medium change. Conclusion: Calculation of MIDs as mean score changes or by ROC analysis suggested that a change in the EORTC QLQ-C30 score in the range of approximately 6\textendash 17 is considered important by patients with MM. These MIDs are closer to a medium effect size than to a small effect size. Our findings imply that mean score changes smaller than 6 are unlikely to be important to the patients, even if these changes are statistically significant.},

Many disciplines, such as neuroscience, psychophysics, visual cognition, and biology have used new technologies to gain insights in understanding the complexities of color perception, yet there exists relatively little research in the field of marketing. This paper aims to reestablish the importance of color research in marketing, draw attention to the complex nature of this research, and to fuel further investigation and the development of new insights about color as it relates to marketing. The authors offer an integrated conceptual framework centered on the embodied and referential meanings of color and highlight the complexities and nuances that researchers must consider in order to develop this area. Insights from and gaps in the extant literature are highlighted to present a set of questions and propositions for future research in this area of investigation.},

Study 2 revealed that because researchers select affective pictures on the extremity of their affective rating without controlling for brightness differences, pictures used in positive conditions of experiments were on average brighter than those used in negative conditions. Going beyond correlational support for our hypothesis, Studies 3 and 4 showed that brighter versions of neutral pictures were evaluated more positively than darker versions of the same picture. Study 5 revealed that people categorized positive words more quickly than negative words after a bright prime picture, and vice versa for negative pictures. Together, these studies provide strong support for the hypotheses that picture brightness influences evaluations.},

Recent studies suggest that black and white stimuli are automatically associated with negativity and positivity. However, structural factors in experimental designs, such as the shared opposition in the valence (good vs. bad) and brightness (light vs. dark) dimensions might play an important role in the valence-brightness association. In six experiments, we show that while black ideographs are consistently judged to represent negative words, white ideographs represent positivity only when the negativity of black is co-activated. The positivity of white emerged only when brightness and valence were manipulated within participants (but not between participants), or when the negativity of black was perceptually activated by presenting positive and white stimuli against a black (vs. grey) background. These findings add to an emerging literature on how structural overlap between dimensions creates associations, and highlight the inherently contextualized construction of meaning structures.},

For scientists themselves, effect sizes are most useful because they facilitate cumulative science. Effect sizes can be used to determine the sample size for follow-up studies, or examining effects across studies. This article aims to provide a practical primer on how to calculate and report effect sizes for t-tests and ANOVA's such that effect sizes can be used in a-priori power analyses and meta-analyses. Whereas many articles about effect sizes focus on between-subjects designs and address within-subjects designs only briefly, I provide a detailed overview of the similarities and differences between within- and between-subjects designs. I suggest that some research questions in experimental psychology examine inherently intra-individual effects, which makes effect sizes that incorporate the correlation between measures the best summary of the results. Finally, a supplementary spreadsheet is provided to make it as easy as possible for researchers to incorporate effect size calculations into their workflow.},

It is essential that meta-analyses can easily be reproduced to allow researchers to evaluate the impact of subjective choices on meta-analytic effect sizes, but also to update meta-analyses as new data comes in, or as novel statistical techniques (for example to correct for publication bias) are developed. Research in medicine has revealed meta-analyses often cannot be reproduced. In this project, we examined the reproducibility of meta-analyses in psychology by reproducing twenty published meta-analyses. Reproducing published meta-analyses was surprisingly difficult. 96\% of meta-analyses published in 2013-2014 did not adhere to reporting guidelines. A third of these meta-analyses did not contain a table specifying all individual effect sizes. Five of the 20 randomly selected meta-analyses we attempted to reproduce could not be reproduced at all due to lack of access to raw data, no details about the effect sizes extracted from each study, or a lack of information about how effect sizes were coded. In the remaining meta-analyses, differences between the reported and reproduced effect size or sample size were common. We discuss a range of possible improvements, such as more clearly indicating which data were used to calculate an effect size, specifying all individual effect sizes, adding detailed information about equations that are used, and how multiple effect size estimates from the same study are combined, but also sharing raw data retrieved from original authors, or unpublished research reports. This project clearly illustrates there is a lot of room for improvement when it comes to the transparency and reproducibility of published meta-analyses.},

Many scientific articles have the goal to test a hypothesis, and making the tests of statistical predictions easier to find and access could be very beneficial. We propose an approach that can be used to make hypothesis tests machine readable. We believe there are two benefits to specifying a hypothesis test in a way that a computer can evaluate whether the statistical prediction is corroborated or not. First, hypothesis test will become more transparent, falsifiable, and rigorous. Second, scientists will benefit if information related to hypothesis tests in scientific articles is easily findable and re-usable, for example when performing meta-analyses, during peer review, and when examining meta-scientific research questions. We examine what a machine readable hypothesis test should looks like, and demonstrate the feasibility of machine readable hypothesis tests in a real-life example.},

  abstract = {Due to the strong overreliance on p-values in the scientific literature some researchers have argued that p-values should be abandoned or banned, and that we need to move beyond p-values and embrace practical alternatives. When proposing alternatives to p-values statisticians often commit the `Statistician's Fallacy', where they declare which statistic researchers really `want to know'. Instead of telling researchers what they want to know, statisticians should teach researchers which questions they can ask. In some situations, the answer to the question they are most interested in will be the p-value. As long as null-hypothesis tests have been criticized, researchers have suggested to include minimum-effect tests and equivalence tests in our statistical toolbox, and these tests (even though they return p-values) have the potential to greatly improve the questions researchers ask. It is clear there is room for improvement in how we teach p-values. If anyone really believes p-values are an important cause of problems in science, preventing the misinterpretation of p-values by developing better evidence-based education and user-centered statistical software should be a top priority. Telling researchers which statistic they should use has distracted us from examining more important questions, such as asking researchers what they want to know when they do scientific research. Before we can improve our statistical inferences, we need to improve our statistical questions.},

Recently, some researchers have argued the replicability crisis social priming research is greatly exaggerated (Dijksterhuis, 2014; Stroebe \& Strack, 2014). To quantify the extent to which researcher degrees of freedom are a real problem, I present two p-curve analyses that examine the evidential value of research lines on professor priming and elderly priming. The results indicate studies examining elderly priming are p-hacked, while studies examining professor priming contain evidential value. I believe a polarized discussion about whether social priming is true or not, whether direct replications or conceptual replications are preferable, or whether methodological rigor or theory development is needed is unlikely to lead to scientific progress. Instead, we have to meta-analytically evaluate individual effects based on their evidential value, and collaboratively examine what is likely to be true.},

To ensure a study is adequately powered to yield informative results when performing an ANOVA, researcher can perform an a-priori power analysis. However, power analysis for factorial ANOVA designs is often a challenge. Current software solutions do not enable power analyses for complex designs with several within-subject factors. Moreover, power analyses often need partial eta-squared or Cohen's f as input, but these effect sizes are not intuitive and do not generalize to different experimental designs. We have created the R package ANOVApower and an online Shiny app to enable researchers without extensive programming experience to perform simulation-based power analysis for ANOVA designs of up to three within- or between-subject factors, with an unlimited number of levels. Predicted effects are entered by specifying means, standard deviations, and correlations (for within-subject factors). The simulation provides the statistical power for all ANOVA main effects, interactions, and individual comparisons, and allow researchers to correct for multiple comparisons. The simulation plots *p*-value distributions for all tests, and power plots across a range of sample sizes. This tutorial will demonstrate how to perform power analysis for ANOVA designs, and highlights important factors that determine the statistical power of factorial ANOVA designs.},

In Experiment 2, neutral and time-related words were presented over headphones. Participants were asked to indicate whether words were louder on the left or right channel. On critical experimental trials, words were presented equally loud binaurally. As predicted, participants judged future words to be louder on the right channel more often than past-related words. Furthermore, there was a significant cross-modal overlap between the visual-spatial ordering (Experiment 1) and the auditory judgments (Experiment 2), which were continuously related. These findings provide support for the assumption that space and time have certain invariant properties that share a common structure across modalities.

As we show, mixed results are not only likely to be observed in lines of research but also, when observed, often provide evidence for the alternative hypothesis, given reasonable levels of statistical power and an adequately controlled low Type 1 error rate.

With the rise of the internet it has become easier to preregister the theoretical and empirical basis for predictions, the experimental design, the materials, and the analysis code. Whether the practice of preregistration is valuable depends on your philosophy of science. Here, I provide a conceptual analysis of the value of preregistration for psychological science from an error statistical philosophy (Mayo, 2018). Preregistration has the goal to allow others to transparently evaluate the capacity of a test to falsify a prediction, or the severity of a test. Researchers who aim to test predictions with severity should find value in the practice of preregistration. I differentiate the goal of preregistration from positive externalities, discuss how preregistration itself does not make a study better or worse compared to a non-preregistered study, and highlight the importance of evaluating the usefulness of a tool such as preregistration based on an explicit consideration of your philosophy of science.},

Experiment 1 demonstrated that having an affiliation goal increases nonconscious mimicry, and Experiment 2 further supported this proposition by demonstrating that people who have unsuccessfully attempted to affiliate in an interaction subsequently exhibit more mimicry than those who have not experienced such a failure. Results suggest that behavioral mimicry may be part of a person's repertoire of behaviors, used nonconsciously, when there is a desire to create rapport.},

Despite the tight historical links between science and philosophy, present-day scientists often perceive philosophy as completely different from, and even antagonistic to, science. We argue here that, to the contrary, philosophy can have an important and productive impact on science.

Despite the tight historical links between science and philosophy, hearkening back to Plato, Aristotle, and others (here evoked with Raphael's famous School of Athens), present-day scientists often perceive philosophy as completely different from, and even antagonistic to, science. To the contrary, we believe philosophy can have an important and productive impact on science. Image credit: Shutterstock.com/Isogood\_patrick.

We illustrate our point with three examples taken from various fields of the contemporary life sciences. Each bears on cutting-edge scientific research, and each has been explicitly acknowledged by practicing researchers as a useful contribution to science. These and other examples show that philosophy's contribution can take at least four forms: the clarification of scientific concepts, the critical assessment of scientific assumptions or methods, the formulation of new concepts and theories, and the fostering of dialogue between different sciences, as well as between science and society.

\#\#\# Conceptual Clarification and Stem Cells.

First, philosophy offers conceptual clarification. Conceptual clarifications not only improve the precision and utility of scientific terms but also lead to novel experimental investigations because the choice of a given conceptual framework strongly constrains how experiments are conceived.

The definition of stem cells is a prime example. Philosophy has a long tradition of investigating properties, and the tools in use in this tradition \ldots{}

Largely due to its ease of use and recommendation from the United States Food and Drug Administration guidance, the most common statistical method for testing equivalence is the two one-sided tests procedure (TOST). Like classical point-null hypothesis testing, TOST is subject to multiplicity concerns as more comparisons are made. In this manuscript, a condition that bounds the family-wise error rate using TOST is given. This condition then leads to a simple solution for controlling the family-wise error rate. Specifically, we demonstrate that if all pair-wise comparisons of k independent groups are being evaluated for equivalence, then simply scaling the nominal Type I error rate down by (k - 1) is sufficient to maintain the family-wise error rate at the desired value or less. The resulting rule is much less conservative than the equally simple Bonferroni correction. An example of equivalence testing in a non drug-development setting is given.},

  abstract = {Nosek et al. (1) recently joined others in advocating for ``widespread adoption of preregistration'' as a tool for advancing science. The language they use in making this important argument, however, creates unnecessary confusion: Like many others discussing these issues, they seem to conflate the goal of theory falsification with the goal of constraining type I error. This masks a crucial distinction between two types of preregistration: preregistering a theoretical, a priori, directional prediction (which serves to clarify how a hypothesis is constructed) and preregistering an analysis plan (which serves to clarify how evidence is produced).

Indeed, philosophers of science have identified elements of both how a hypothesis is constructed and how evidence is \ldots{}

The purpose of conducting a pilot study is to examine the feasibility of an approach that is intended to be used in a larger scale study. The roles and limitations of pilot studies are described here using a clinical trial as an example. A pilot study can be used to evaluate the feasibility of recruitment, randomization, retention, assessment procedures, new methods, and implementation of the novel intervention., A pilot study is not a hypothesis testing study. Safety, efficacy and effectiveness are not evaluated in a pilot. Contrary to tradition, a pilot study does not provide a meaningful effect size estimate for planning subsequent studies due to the imprecision inherent in data from small samples. Feasibility results do not necessarily generalize beyond the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the pilot design., A pilot study is a requisite initial step in exploring a novel intervention or an innovative application of an intervention. Pilot results can inform feasibility and identify modifications needed in the design of a larger, ensuing hypothesis testing study. Investigators should be forthright in stating these objectives of a pilot study. Grant reviewers and other stakeholders should expect no more.},

It is unclear how total scores translate into clinical severity, or what commonly used measures for response (reduction from baseline of {$\geq$}50\% in the total score) and remission (total HAMD-17 score {$\leq$}7) mean from a clinical perspective. We therefore compared: (a) the percentage and absolute change in the HAMD-17 total scores with Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I); (b) the absolute and percentage change in the HAMD-17 total scores with Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) absolute change; and (c) the percentage and absolute change in the HAMD-17 total scores with CGI-I in the subgroups of patients with{$\leq$}median and{$>$}median HAMD-17 total scores at baseline. The method used was equipercentile linking of HAMD-17 and CGI ratings from 43 drug trials in patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) (n=7131). Our results confirm the validity of the commonly used measures for remission and response in MDD trials: a CGI-I score of 2 (`much improved') corresponded to a reduction from baseline of {$>$}50\% and {$<$}60\%, and a CGI-I score of 1 (`very much improved') to a reduction of {$>$}75\% and {$<$}85\%. The CGI-S score of 1 (`normal., not at all ill') corresponded to the HAMD-17 total score of {$<$}5 and the CGI-S score of 2 (`borderline mentally ill') to the score between 6 and 8. An effect of baseline illness severity was observed.},

Usually trivial with the z test, the errors might be important where {$\alpha$} is large and effect size is small or with tests using other distributions. One can avoid the errors by using calculations that apply to directional decisions or by using a directional two-tailed test at the outset, a conceptually simpler solution. With a revised concept of power, this article shows calculations for the test; explains how to find its power, Type III error risk, and sample size in statistical tables for traditional tests; compares it to conventional one- and two-tailed tests and to one- and two-sided confidence intervals; and concludes that when a significance test is planned it is the best choice for most purposes.

  abstract = {Researchers often lack knowledge about how to deal with outliers when analyzing their data. Even more frequently, researchers do not pre-specify how they plan to manage outliers. In this paper we aim to improve research practices by outlining what you need to know about outliers. We start by providing a functional definition of outliers. We then lay down an appropriate nomenclature/classification of outliers.~This nomenclature is used to understand what kinds of outliers can be encountered and serves as a guideline to make appropriate decisions regarding the conservation, deletion, or recoding of outliers. These decisions might impact the validity of statistical inferences as well as the reproducibility of our experiments. To be able to make informed decisions about outliers you first need proper detection tools. We remind readers why the most common outlier detection methods are problematic and recommend the use of the median absolute deviation to detect univariate outliers, and of the Mahalanobis-MCD distance to detect multivariate outliers. An R package was created that can be used to easily perform these detection tests. Finally, we promote the use of pre-registration to avoid flexibility in data analysis when handling outliers.

  abstract = {It is widely acknowledged that data sharing has great potential for scientific progress. However, so far making data available has little impact on a researcher's reputation. Thus, data sharing can be conceptualized as a social dilemma. In the presented study we investigated the influence of the researcher's personality within the social dilemma of data sharing. The theoretical background was the appropriateness framework. We conducted a survey among 1564 researchers about data sharing, which also included standardized questions on selected personality factors, namely the so-called Big Five, Machiavellianism and social desirability. Using regression analysis, we investigated how these personality domains relate to four groups of dependent variables: attitudes towards data sharing, the importance of factors that might foster or hinder data sharing, the willingness to share data, and actual data sharing. Our analyses showed the predictive value of personality for all four groups of dependent variables. However, there was not a global consistent pattern of influence, but rather different compositions of effects. Our results indicate that the implications of data sharing are dependent on age, gender, and personality. In order to foster data sharing, it seems advantageous to provide more personal incentives and to address the researchers' individual responsibility.},

In this paper, we describe our approach to enabling computational reproducibility for the 12 papers in this special issue of Socius about the Fragile Families Challenge. Our approach draws on two tools commonly used by professional software engineers but not widely used by academic researchers: software containers (e.g., Docker) and cloud computing (e.g., Amazon Web Services). These tools enabled us to standardize the computing environment around each submission, which will ease computational reproducibility both today and in the future. Drawing on our successes and struggles, we conclude with recommendations to authors and journals.},

  abstract = {The downstream consequences of a priming induction range from changes in the perception of objects in the environment to the initiation of prime-related behavior and goal striving. Although each of these outcomes has been accounted for by separate mechanisms, we argue that a single process could produce all three priming effects. In this article, we introduce the situated inference model of priming, discuss its potential to account for these divergent outcomes with one mechanism, and demonstrate its ability to organize the priming literatures surrounding these effects. According to the model, primes often do not cause direct effects, instead altering only the accessibility of prime-related mental content. This information produces downstream effects on judgment, behavior, or motivation when it is mistakenly viewed as originating from one's own internal thought processes. When this misattribution occurs, the prime-related mental content becomes a possible source of information for solving whatever problems are afforded by the current situation. Because different situations afford very different questions and concerns, the inferred meaning of this prime-related content can vary greatly. The use of this information to answer qualitatively different questions can lead a single prime to produce varied effects on judgment, behavior, and motivation.},

  abstract = {Magnitude-based inference (MBI) is a controversial statistical method that has been used in hundreds of papers in sports science despite criticism from statisticians. To better understand how this method has been applied in practice, we systematically reviewed 232 papers that used MBI. We extracted data on study design, sample size, and choice of MBI settings and parameters. Median sample size was 10 per group (interquartile range, IQR: 8 \textendash{} 15) for multi-group studies and 14 (IQR: 10 \textendash{} 24) for single-group studies; few studies reported a priori sample size calculations (15\%). Authors predominantly applied MBI's default settings and chose ``mechanistic/non-clinical'' rather than ``clinical'' MBI even when testing clinical interventions (only 14 studies out of 232 used clinical MBI). Using these data, we can estimate the Type I error rates for the typical MBI study. Authors frequently made dichotomous claims about effects based on the MBI criterion of a ``likely'' effect and sometimes based on the MBI criterion of a ``possible'' effect. When the sample size is n=8 to 15 per group, these inferences have Type I error rates of 12\%-22\% and 22\%-45\%, respectively. High Type I error rates were compounded by multiple testing: Authors reported results from a median of 30 tests related to outcomes; and few studies specified a primary outcome (14\%). We conclude that MBI has promoted small studies, promulgated a ``black box'' approach to statistics, and led to numerous papers where the conclusions are not supported by the data. Amidst debates over the role of p-values and significance testing in science, MBI also provides an important natural experiment: we find no evidence that moving researchers away from p-values or null hypothesis significance testing makes them less prone to dichotomization or over-interpretation of findings.},

  abstract = {In the presence of heteroscedasticity, ordinary least squares (OLS) estimates are unbiased, but the usual tests of significance are generally inappropriate and their use can lead to incorrect inferences. Tests based on a heteroscedasticity consistent covariance matrix (HCCM), however, are consistent even in the presence of heteroscedasticity of an unknown form. Most applications that use a HCCM appear to rely on the asymptotic version known as HC0. Our Monte Carlo simulations show that HC0 often results in incorrect inferences when N {$\leq$} 250, while three relatively unknown, small sample versions of the HCCM, and especially a version known as HC3, work well even for N's as small as 25. We recommend that: (1) data analysts should correct for heteroscedasticity using a HCCM whenever there is reason to suspect heteroscedasticity; (2) the decision to use HCCM-based tests should not be determined by a screening test for heteroscedasticity; and (3) when N {$\leq$} 250, the HCCM known as HC3 should be used. Since HC3 is simple to compute, we encourage authors of statistical software to add this estimator to their programs.},

  publisher = {{Princeton University Press}},
  abstract = {"Helen Longino has written a timely book that fills a critical gap in the existing literature between philosophy of science and the social studies of science. Her exposition of scientific inquiry as a context-laden process provides the conceptual tools we need to understand how social expectations shape the development of science while at the same time recognizing the dependence of scientific inquiry on its interactions with natural phenomena. This is an important book precisely because there is none other quite like it." --Evelyn Fox Keller, author of "Reflections on Gender and Science" Conventional wisdom has it that the sciences, properly pursued, constitute a pure, value-free method of obtaining knowledge about the natural world. In light of the social and normative dimensions of many scientific debates, Helen Longino finds that general accounts of scientific methodology cannot support this common belief. Focusing on the notion of evidence, the author argues that a methodology powerful enough to account for theories of any scope and depth is incapable of ruling out the influence of social and cultural values in the very structuring of knowledge. The objectivity of scientific inquiry can nevertheless be maintained, she proposes, by understanding scientific inquiry as a social rather than an individual process. Seeking to open a dialogue between methodologists and social critics of the sciences, Longino develops this concept of "contextual empiricism" in an analysis of research programs that have drawn criticism from feminists. Examining theories of human evolution and of prenatal hormonal determination of "gender-role" behavior, of sex differences in cognition, and of sexualorientation, the author shows how assumptions laden with social values affect the description, presentation, and interpretation of data. In particular, Longino argues that research on the hormonal basis of "sex-differentiated behavior" involves assumptions not only about gender relations but also about human action and agency. She concludes with a discussion of the relation between science, values, and ideology, based on the work of Habermas, Foucault, Keller, and Haraway.},

  abstract = {This chapter reviews relevant research on emotion, focusing on aspects of emotion that are most relevant to human factors design. The review begins with a discussion of basic emotion concepts, such as low-level positive and negative affect; emotion dimensions of arousal and valence; and prototypical emotions, such as anger, happiness, and fear. The interaction between emotion processing and cognitive processes, such as attention, perception, and decision making, is also discussed. After a review of the nature of emotion, the problem of measuring emotions is considered. Available techniques for emotion measurement are surveyed, and recommendations are made concerning which techniques should be used in different contexts and interactive settings. Novel measures are also introduced for assessing variability in emotional experience and for measuring emotional expressiveness. After laying the intellectual groundwork for understanding the nature of emotional interaction and its measurement, the chapter then shifts to exploring the implications of emotional processing for the design of interactive systems. Affective designs are reviewed in the following domains: consumer products, health care, and robots. The chapter concludes with presentation of an initial set of guidelines relating to the design of interactive systems that take into account emotional processing. The material presented in this chapter is highly relevant to human factors engineering because knowledge of emotional processing and how it affects the state of operators or users and their performance can lead to more usable, effective, efficient, and satisfying interaction.},

  abstract = {A number of recent research publications have shown that commonly used guidelines for interpreting effect sizes suggested by Cohen (1988) do not fit well with the empirical distribution of those effect sizes, and tend to overestimate them in many research areas. This study proposes empirically derived guidelines for interpreting effect sizes for research in social psychology, based on analysis of the true distributions of the two types of effect size measures widely used in social psychology (correlation coefficient and standardized mean differences). Analysis was carried out on the empirical distribution of 9884 correlation coefficients and 3580 Hedges' g statistics extracted from studies included in 98 published meta-analyses. The analysis reveals that the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles corresponded to correlation coefficients values of 0.12, 0.25, and 0.42 and to Hedges' g values of 0.15, 0.38, and 0.69, respectively. This suggests that Cohen's guidelines tend to overestimate medium and large effect sizes. It is recommended that correlation coefficients of 0.10, 0.25, and 0.40 and Hedges' g of 0.15, 0.40, and 0.70 should be interpreted as small, medium, and large effects for studies in social psychology. The analysis also shows that more than half of all studies lack sufficient sample size to detect a medium effect. This paper reports the sample sizes required to achieve appropriate statistical power for the identification of small, medium, and large effects. This can be used for performing appropriately powered future studies when information about exact effect size is not available.},

  abstract = {It is argued that statistical testing has been overvalued because it is perceived as an optimal, objective, algorithmic method of testing hypotheses. Researchers need to be made aware of the subjective nature of statistical inference in order not to make too much of it. Examples are given of aspects of data that are ignored in the computation of p values but are relevant to their interpretation. These include the fit of the chance distribution, the presence of influential points, the possibilities for post hoc selectivity, the presence of expected and unexpected trends in the data, and the amount of sampling variability that is present. Researchers should be taught that although probabilistic reasoning is a deductive process, making inferences from data is not. There is always potentially relevant information available over and above that which has been taken account of by any p value. Indeed, it is noted that a probability can never characterize all the uncertainty regarding an event because of problems to do with self-reference. Theories of statistical inference need to be weakened to take these ideas into account. Statistical tests assess the implausibility of supposing that the sign of a difference can be explained away as due to sampling error and they work only to the extent that this implausibility can be inferred from the size of the test statistic. The process of inferring plausibility is a subjective one and is inconsistent with the Neyman-Pearson Theory of statistical testing and Fisher's notion of fiducial statistical tests. Probabilities need to be assessed in the context of what they have and have not taken into account and this weakens Bayesian statistical inferences as well as classical ones.},

For example, although publication is a critical element in determining the contribution and impact of scientific findings, little research attention has been devoted to the variables operative in journal review policies. In the present study, 75 journal reviewers were asked to referee manuscripts which described identical experimental procedures but which reported positive, negative, mixed, or no results. In addition to showing poor interrater agreement, reviewers were strongly biased against manuscripts which reported results contrary to their theoretical perspective. The implications of these findings for epistemology and the peer review system are briefly addressed.},

But how prevalent are the use of problematic practices and the improved practices meant to counter them? This baseline information will be a critical data source as education researchers seek to improve our research practices. In this preregistered study, we replicated and extended previous studies from other fields by asking education researchers about 10 questionable research practices and 5 open research practices. We asked them to estimate the prevalence of the practices in the field, self-report their own use of such practices, and estimate the appropriateness of these behaviors in education research. We made predictions under four umbrella categories: comparison to psychology, geographic location, career stage, and quantitative orientation. Broadly, our results suggest that both questionable and open research practices are part of the typical research practices of many educational researchers.

Bayesian statisticians have argued that trials should be designed to maximize subjective expected utility in settings of clinical interest. This perspective is compelling given a credible prior distribution on treatment response, but there is rarely consensus on what the subjective prior beliefs should be. We use Wald's frequentist statistical decision theory to study design of trials under ambiguity. We show that {$\epsilon$}-optimal rules exist when trials have large enough sample size. An {$\epsilon$}-optimal rule has expected welfare within {$\epsilon$} of the welfare of the best treatment in every state of nature. Equivalently, it has maximum regret no larger than {$\epsilon$}. We consider trials that draw predetermined numbers of subjects at random within groups stratified by covariates and treatments. We report exact results for the special case of two treatments and binary outcomes. We give simple sufficient conditions on sample sizes that ensure existence of {$\epsilon$}-optimal treatment rules when there are multiple treatments and outcomes are bounded. These conditions are obtained by application of Hoeffding large deviations inequalities to evaluate the performance of empirical success rules.},

Unfortunately, researchers commonly use concepts of statistical inference whose foundations are distant from the problem of treatment choice. It has been particularly common to use hypothesis tests to compare treatments. Wald's development of statistical decision theory provides a coherent frequentist framework for use of sample data on treatment response to make treatment decisions. A body of recent research applies statistical decision theory to characterize uniformly satisfactory treatment choices, in the sense of maximum loss relative to optimal decisions (also known as maximum regret). This article describes the basic ideas and findings, which provide an appealing practical alternative to use of hypothesis tests. For simplicity, the article focuses on medical treatment with evidence from classical randomized clinical trials. The ideas apply generally, encompassing use of observational data and treatment choice in nonmedical contexts.},

Soc. Psychol. 45, 137\textendash 141. (doi:10.1027/1864-9335/a000192)). First, individual-experiment Bayesian parameter estimation revealed that for directed effect size measures, only three out of 44 central 95\% credible intervals did not overlap with zero and fell in the expected direction. For undirected effect size measures, only four out of 59 credible intervals contained values greater than 0.100.10{$<$}mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"{$><$}mml:mn{$>$}0.10{$<$}/mml:mn{$><$}/mml:math{$>$} (10\% of variance explained) and only 19 intervals contained values larger than 0.050.05{$<$}mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"{$><$}mml:mn{$>$}0.05{$<$}/mml:mn{$><$}/mml:math{$>$}. Second, a Bayesian random-effects meta-analysis for all 38 t-tests showed that only one out of the 38 hierarchically estimated credible intervals did not overlap with zero and fell in the expected direction. Third, a Bayes factor hypothesis test was used to quantify the evidence for the null hypothesis against a default one-sided alternative. Only seven out of 60 Bayes factors indicated non-anecdotal support in favour of the alternative hypothesis (BF10{$>$}3BF10{$>$}3{$<$}mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"{$><$}mml:msub{$><$}mml:mrow{$><$}mml:mi mathvariant="normal"{$>$}BF{$<$}/mml:mi{$><$}/mml:mrow{$><$}mml:mrow{$><$}mml:mn{$>$}10{$<$}/mml:mn{$><$}/mml:mrow{$><$}/mml:msub{$><$}mml:mo{$>\&$}gt;{$<$}/mml:mo{$><$}mml:mn{$>$}3{$<$}/mml:mn{$><$}/mml:math{$>$}), whereas 51 Bayes factors indicated at least some support for the null hypothesis. We hope that future analyses of replication success will embrace a more inclusive statistical approach by adopting a wider range of complementary techniques.},

For parameter d, three pairs of hypothesis may be of interest: H1: d {$\leq$} {$\delta$} vs. K1: d {$>$} {$\delta$}; H2: d {$\not\in$} ({$\delta$}1, {$\delta$}2) vs. K2: d {$\in$} ({$\delta$}1, {$\delta$}2); and H3: d {$\in$} [{$\delta$}1, {$\delta$}2] vs. K3: d {$\not\in$} [{$\delta$}1, {$\delta$}2], where Hi is the null hypothesis and Ki is the alternative hypothesis. These tests are useful in clinical trials, pharmacological and vaccine studies and in statistics generally. The three problems may be investigated by exact unconditional tests when the sample sizes are moderate. Otherwise, one should use approximate (or asymptotical) tests generally based on a Z-statistics like those suggested in the paper. The article defines a new procedure for testing H2 or H3, demonstrates that this is more powerful than tests based on confidence intervals (the classic TOST \textendash{} two one sided tests \textendash{} test), defines two corrections for continuity which reduce the liberality of the three tests, and selects the one that behaves better.

  abstract = {Supplemental Digital Content is available in the text., Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), a prominent tool for expressing assumptions in epidemiologic research, are most useful when the hypothetical data generating structure is correctly encoded. Understanding a study's data generating structure and translating that data structure into a DAG can be challenging, but these skills are often glossed over in training. Campbell and Stanley's framework for causal inference has been extraordinarily influential in social science training programs but has received less attention in epidemiology. Their work, along with subsequent revisions and enhancements based on practical experience conducting empirical studies, presents a catalog of 37 threats to validity describing reasons empirical studies may fail to deliver causal effects. We interpret most of these threats to study validity as suggestions for common causal structures. Threats are organized into issues of statistical conclusion validity, internal validity, construct validity, or external validity. To assist epidemiologists in drawing the correct DAG for their application, we map the correspondence between threats to validity and epidemiologic concepts that can be represented with DAGs. Representing these threats as DAGs makes them amenable to formal analysis with d-separation rules and breaks down cross-disciplinary language barriers in communicating methodologic issues.},

  abstract = {Designing Experiments and Analyzing Data: A Model Comparison Perspective (3rd edition) offers an integrative conceptual framework for understanding experimental design and data analysis. Maxwell, Delaney, and Kelley first apply fundamental principles to simple experimental designs followed by an application of the same principles to more complicated designs. Their integrative conceptual framework better prepares readers to understand the logic behind a general strategy of data analysis that is appropriate for a wide variety of designs, which allows for the introduction of more complex topics that are generally omitted from other books. Numerous pedagogical features further facilitate understanding: examples of published research demonstrate the applicability of each chapter's content; flowcharts assist in choosing the most appropriate procedure; end-of-chapter lists of important formulas highlight key ideas and assist readers in locating the initial presentation of equations; useful programming code and tips are provided throughout the book and in associated resources available online, and extensive sets of exercises help develop a deeper understanding of the subject. Detailed solutions for some of the exercises and realistic data sets are included on the website (DesigningExperiments.com). The pedagogical approach used throughout the book enables readers to gain an overview of experimental design, from conceptualization of the research question to analysis of the data. The book and its companion website with web apps, tutorials, and detailed code are ideal for students and researchers seeking the optimal way to design their studies and analyze the resulting data.},

The "curse of multiplicities" plays a central role in the presentation. Most psychologists realize that testing multiple hypotheses in a single study affects the Type I error rate, but corresponding implications for power have largely been ignored. The presence of multiple hypothesis tests leads to 3 different conceptualizations of power. Implications of these 3 conceptualizations are discussed from the perspective of the individual researcher and from the perspective of developing a coherent literature. Supplementing significance tests with effect size measures and confidence intervals is shown to address some but not necessarily all problems associated with multiple testing.},

It is no surprise that x fits H, if H was deliberately constructed to accord with x. The question of when and why we should avoid such ``double-counting'' continues to be debated in philosophy and statistics. It arises as a prohibition against data mining, hunting for significance, tuning on the signal, and ad hoc hypotheses, and as a preference for predesignated hypotheses and ``surprising'' predictions. I have argued that it is the severity or probativeness of the test\textemdash or lack of it\textemdash that should determine whether a double-use of data is admissible.

  abstract = {Srull and Wyer (1979) demonstrated that exposing participants to more hostility-related stimuli caused them subsequently to interpret ambiguous behaviors as more hostile. In their Experiment 1, participants descrambled sets of words to form sentences. In one condition, 80\% of the descrambled sentences described hostile behaviors, and in another condition, 20\% described hostile behaviors. Following the descrambling task, all participants read a vignette about a man named Donald who behaved in an ambiguously hostile manner and then rated him on a set of personality traits. Next, participants rated the hostility of various ambiguously hostile behaviors (all ratings on scales from 0 to 10). Participants who descrambled mostly hostile sentences rated Donald and the ambiguous behaviors as approximately 3 scale points more hostile than did those who descrambled mostly neutral sentences. This Registered Replication Report describes the results of 26 independent replications (N = 7,373 in the total sample; k = 22 labs and N = 5,610 in the primary analyses) of Srull and Wyer's Experiment 1, each of which followed a preregistered and vetted protocol. A random-effects meta-analysis showed that the protagonist was seen as 0.08 scale points more hostile when participants were primed with 80\% hostile sentences than when they were primed with 20\% hostile sentences (95\% confidence interval, CI = [0.004, 0.16]). The ambiguously hostile behaviors were seen as 0.08 points less hostile when participants were primed with 80\% hostile sentences than when they were primed with 20\% hostile sentences (95\% CI = [-0.18, 0.01]). Although the confidence interval for one outcome excluded zero and the observed effect was in the predicted direction, these results suggest that the currently used methods do not produce an assimilative priming effect that is practically and routinely detectable.},

  abstract = {Many published research results are false (Ioannidis, 2005), and controversy continues over the roles of replication and publication policy in improving the reliability of research. Addressing these problems is frustrated by the lack of a formal framework that jointly represents hypothesis formation, replication, publication bias, and variation in research quality. We develop a mathematical model of scientific discovery that combines all of these elements. This model provides both a dynamic model of research as well as a formal framework for reasoning about the normative structure of science. We show that replication may serve as a ratchet that gradually separates true hypotheses from false, but the same factors that make initial findings unreliable also make replications unreliable. The most important factors in improving the reliability of research are the rate of false positives and the base rate of true hypotheses, and we offer suggestions for addressing each. Our results also bring clarity to verbal debates about the communication of research. Surprisingly, publication bias is not always an obstacle, but instead may have positive impacts\textemdash suppression of negative novel findings is often beneficial. We also find that communication of negative replications may aid true discovery even when attempts to replicate have diminished power. The model speaks constructively to ongoing debates about the design and conduct of science, focusing analysis and discussion on precise, internally consistent models, as well as highlighting the importance of population dynamics.},

In many circumstances, violating these assumptions yields estimates of reliability that are too small, making measures look less reliable than they actually are. Although methodological critiques of Cronbach's alpha are being cited with increasing frequency in empirical studies, in this tutorial we discuss how the trend is not necessarily improving methodology used in the literature. That is, many studies continue to use Cronbach's alpha without regard for its assumptions or merely cite methodological articles advising against its use to rationalize unfavorable Cronbach's alpha estimates. This tutorial first provides evidence that recommendations against Cronbach's alpha have not appreciably changed how empirical studies report reliability. Then, we summarize the drawbacks of Cronbach's alpha conceptually without relying on mathematical or simulation-based arguments so that these arguments are accessible to a broad audience. We continue by discussing several alternative measures that make less rigid assumptions which provide justifiably higher estimates of reliability compared to Cronbach's alpha. We conclude with empirical examples to illustrate advantages of alternative measures of reliability including omega total, Revelle's omega total, the greatest lower bound, and Coefficient H. A detailed software appendix is also provided to help researchers implement alternative methods.},

  abstract = {A large amount of variation exists in beliefs about the purpose and benefits of preregistration, making it difficult to implement and evaluate, and limiting its usefulness. In this paper, I describe standards for an ideal preregistration. Specifically, preregistration should 1) restrict as many researcher degrees of freedom as possible, 2) detail all aspects of a study's method and analysis, 3) detail information on decisions made during the planning stages, and 4) specify how the results will be used and interpreted. This careful planning should also be publicly verifiable. I argue that preregistrations which do not address each of these points do more harm than good by falsely signalling credibility and quality, and they risk becoming another `ritual' that psychologists perform. Further, I argue that preregistration is not limited to situations where hypotheses are tested and p-values are reported. Instead, preregistration should be used in any situation where re-searchers intend to collect data in order to make a claim, description, decision, or inference based on that data. In outlining these criteria, I also propose that researchers reconceptualise preregistration and think of it as the methods section of a research report. A preregistration that functions as the methods section of a completed research report should be standardised, comprehensive, and will save time and improve transparency. A working preregistration form is proposed which satisfies all of these requirements (https://osf.io/6qv2b). It is proposed that the preregistration form is used as the methods section of a completed research report, simultaneously enhancing the study planning pro-cess and facilitating the review process.},

We then discuss our own proposal, which is to abandon statistical significance. We recommend dropping the NHST paradigm\textemdash and the p-value thresholds intrinsic to it\textemdash as the default statistical paradigm for research, publication, and discovery in the biomedical and social sciences. Specifically, we propose that the p-value be demoted from its threshold screening role and instead, treated continuously, be considered along with currently subordinate factors (e.g., related prior evidence, plausibility of mechanism, study design and data quality, real world costs and benefits, novelty of finding, and other factors that vary by research domain) as just one among many pieces of evidence. We have no desire to ``ban'' p-values or other purely statistical measures. Rather, we believe that such measures should not be thresholded and that, thresholded or not, they should not take priority over the currently subordinate factors. We also argue that it seldom makes sense to calibrate evidence as a function of p-values or other purely statistical measures. We offer recommendations for how our proposal can be implemented in the scientific publication process as well as in statistical decision making more broadly.},

While the ASA Statement notes that statistical significance and p-values are ``commonly misused and misinterpreted,'' it does not discuss and document broader implications of these errors for the interpretation of evidence. In this article, we review research on how applied researchers who are not primarily statisticians misuse and misinterpret p-values in practice and how this can lead to errors in the interpretation of evidence. We also present new data showing, perhaps surprisingly, that researchers who are primarily statisticians are also prone to misuse and misinterpret p-values thus resulting in similar errors. In particular, we show that statisticians tend to interpret evidence dichotomously based on whether or not a p-value crosses the conventional 0.05 threshold for statistical significance. We discuss implications and offer recommendations.},

Most VOI studies use decision-analytic models to characterize the uncertainty of the effects of interventions on health outcomes, but the complexity of constructing such models can pose barriers to some practical applications of VOI. However, because some clinical studies can directly characterize uncertainty in health outcomes, it may sometimes be possible to perform VOI analysis with only minimal modeling. This article 1) develops a framework to define and classify minimal modeling approaches to VOI, 2) reviews existing VOI studies that apply minimal modeling approaches, and 3) illustrates and discusses the application of the minimal modeling to 2 new clinical applications to which the approach appears well suited because clinical trials with comprehensive outcomes provide preliminary estimates of the uncertainty in outcomes. The authors conclude that minimal modeling approaches to VOI can be readily applied in some instances to estimate the expected benefits of clinical research.},

  abstract = {The aim of this paper is to provide a Bayesian formulation of the so-called magnitude-based inference approach to quantifying and interpreting effects, and in a case study example provide accurate probabilistic statements that correspond to the intended magnitude-based inferences. The model is described in the context of a published small-scale athlete study which employed a magnitude-based inference approach to compare the effect of two altitude training regimens (live high-train low (LHTL), and intermittent hypoxic exposure (IHE)) on running performance and blood measurements of elite triathletes. The posterior distributions, and corresponding point and interval estimates, for the parameters and associated effects and comparisons of interest, were estimated using Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations. The Bayesian analysis was shown to provide more direct probabilistic comparisons of treatments and able to identify small effects of interest. The approach avoided asymptotic assumptions and overcame issues such as multiple testing. Bayesian analysis of unscaled effects showed a probability of 0.96 that LHTL yields a substantially greater increase in hemoglobin mass than IHE, a 0.93 probability of a substantially greater improvement in running economy and a greater than 0.96 probability that both IHE and LHTL yield a substantially greater improvement in maximum blood lactate concentration compared to a Placebo. The conclusions are consistent with those obtained using a `magnitude-based inference' approach that has been promoted in the field. The paper demonstrates that a fully Bayesian analysis is a simple and effective way of analysing small effects, providing a rich set of results that are straightforward to interpret in terms of probabilistic statements.},

Here, we extend this research by investigating whether the degree of coordination observed in a joint action enhances the perception of individuals' commitment to the joint action. In four experiments, participants viewed videos of joint actions. In the low coordination condition, two agents made independent individual contributions to a joint action. In the high coordination condition, the individual contributions were tightly linked. Participants judged whether and for how long the observed agents would resist a tempting outside option and remain engaged in the joint action. The results showed that participants were more likely to expect agents to resist outside options when observing joint actions with a high degree of coordination. This indicates that observing interpersonal coordination is sufficient to enhance the perception of commitment to joint action.},

The model can be used to quantify various trade-offs inherent in the research process and thus to balance competing goals, such as (a) maximizing both the number of studies carried out and also the statistical power of each study, (b) minimizing the rates of both false positive and false negative findings, and (c) maximizing both replicability and research efficiency. Given certain necessary information about a research area, the model can be used to determine the optimal values of sample size, statistical power, rate of false positives, rate of false negatives, and replicability, such that overall research payoff is maximized. More specifically, the model shows how the optimal values of these quantities depend upon the size and frequency of true effects within the area, as well as the individual payoffs associated with particular study outcomes. The model is particularly relevant within current discussions of how to optimize the productivity of scientific research, because it shows which aspects of a research area must be considered and how these aspects combine to determine total research payoff.},

  abstract = {Researchers who analyze data within the framework of null hypothesis significance testing must choose a critical ``alpha'' level, {$\alpha$}, to use as a cutoff for deciding whether a given set of data demonstrates the presence of a particular effect. In most fields, {$\alpha$} = 0.05 has traditionally been used as the standard cutoff. Many researchers have recently argued for a change to a more stringent evidence cutoff such as {$\alpha$} = 0.01, 0.005, or 0.001, noting that this change would tend to reduce the rate of false positives, which are of growing concern in many research areas. Other researchers oppose this proposed change, however, because it would correspondingly tend to increase the rate of false negatives. We show how a simple statistical model can be used to explore the quantitative tradeoff between reducing false positives and increasing false negatives. In particular, the model shows how the optimal {$\alpha$} level depends on numerous characteristics of the research area, and it reveals that although {$\alpha$} = 0.05 would indeed be approximately the optimal value in some realistic situations, the optimal {$\alpha$} could actually be substantially larger or smaller in other situations. The importance of the model lies in making it clear what characteristics of the research area have to be specified to make a principled argument for using one {$\alpha$} level rather than another, and the model thereby provides a blueprint for researchers seeking to justify a particular {$\alpha$} level.},

  abstract = {Parkinson's disease (PD) is often characterized by asymmetrical symptoms, which are more prominent on the side of the body contralateral to the most extensively affected brain hemisphere. Therefore, lateralized PD presents an opportunity to examine the effects of asymmetric subcortical dopamine deficiencies on cognitive functioning. As it has been hypothesized that inhibitory control relies upon a right-lateralized pathway, we tested whether left-dominant PD (LPD) patients suffered from a more severe deficit in this key executive function than right-dominant PD patients (RPD). To this end, via a countermanding task, we assessed both proactive and reactive inhibition in 20 LPD and 20 RPD patients, and in 20 age-matched healthy subjects. As expected, we found that PD patients were significantly more impaired in both forms of inhibitory control than healthy subjects. However, there were no differences either in reactive or proactive inhibition between LPD and RPD patients. All in all, these data support the idea that brain regions affected by PD play a fundamental role in subserving inhibitory function, but do not sustain the hypothesis according to which this executive function is predominantly or solely computed by the brain regions of the right hemisphere.},

A total of 42 independent studies (N = 4327) were analyzed in which experimentally manipulated synchronous actions were compared to control conditions in healthy non-clinical samples. Our random effects model indicated that synchronous actions affected all four dimensions of response. Synchrony had a medium-sized positive effect on prosocial behaviors, a small-to-medium-sized positive effect on both perceived social bonding and social cognition, and a small-sized positive effect on positive affect. Notably, synchrony in larger groups increased prosocial behavior and positive affect, but group size did not moderate the relationship between synchrony and perceived social bonding and social cognition. This pattern suggests that distinct process mechanisms (neurocognitive versus affective) might underpin synchrony's effects on dimensions of response as a function of group size.},

  abstract = {Meta-analyses indicate that antidepressants are superior to placebos in statistical terms, but the clinical relevance of the differences has not been established. Previous suggestions of clinically relevant effect sizes have not been supported by empirical evidence. In the current paper we apply an empirical method that consists of comparing scores obtained on the Hamilton rating scale for depression (HAM-D) and scores from the Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement (CGI-I) scale. This method reveals that a HAM-D difference of 3 points is undetectable by clinicians using the CGI-I scale. A difference of 7 points on the HAM-D, or an effect size of 0.875, is required to correspond to a rating of `minimal improvement' on the CGI-I. By these criteria differences between antidepressants and placebo in randomised controlled trials, including trials conducted with people diagnosed with very severe depression, are not detectable by clinicians and fall far short of levels consistent with clinically observable minimal levels of improvement. Clinical significance should be considered alongside statistical significance when making decisions about the approval and use of medications like antidepressants.},

The ability to support these simplifying assumptions with statistical evidence is crucial to scientific progress, though it might involve "accepting" the null hypothesis. We review two historical examples where statistical evidence was used to accept a simplifying assumption (rejecting the luminiferous aether and genetic theory) and one where the null hypothesis was not accepted in spite of repeated failures (gravitational waves), drawing lessons from each. We emphasize the role of the scientific context in the acceptance of the null: accepting the null is never a purely statistical affair.},

  abstract = {Co-speech gestures traditionally have been considered communicative, but they may also serve other functions. For example, hand-arm movements seem to facilitate both spatial working memory and speech production. It has been proposed that gestures facilitate speech indirectly by sustaining spatial representations in working memory. Alternatively, gestures may affect speech production directly, by activating embodied semantic representations involved in lexical search. Consistent with the first hypothesis, we found participants gestured more when describing visual objects from memory and when describing objects that were difficult to remember and encode verbally. However, they also gestured when describing a visually-accessible object, and gesture-restriction produced dysfluent speech even when spatial memory was untaxed, suggesting that gestures can directly affect both spatial memory and lexical retrieval.},

Reported estimates of the VSL vary substantially, from less than \$100,000 to more than \$25 million. This research uses meta-analysis to quantitatively assess the VSL literature. Results from existing studies are pooled to identify the systematic relationships between VSL estimates and each study's particular features, such as the sample composition and research methods. This meta-analysis suggests that a VSL range of approximately \$1.5 million to \$2.5 million (in 1998 dollars) is what can be reasonably inferred from past labor-market studies when ``best practice'' assumptions are invoked. This range is considerably below many previous qualitative reviews of this literature. \textcopyright{} 2002 by the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management.},

  abstract = {Null hypothesis significance testing has been under attack in recent years, partly owing to the arbitrary nature of setting {$\alpha$} (the decision-making threshold and probability of Type I error) at a constant value, usually 0.05. If the goal of null hypothesis testing is to present conclusions in which we have the highest possible confidence, then the only logical decision-making threshold is the value that minimizes the probability (or occasionally, cost) of making errors. Setting {$\alpha$} to minimize the combination of Type I and Type II error at a critical effect size can easily be accomplished for traditional statistical tests by calculating the {$\alpha$} associated with the minimum average of {$\alpha$} and {$\beta$} at the critical effect size. This technique also has the flexibility to incorporate prior probabilities of null and alternate hypotheses and/or relative costs of Type I and Type II errors, if known. Using an optimal {$\alpha$} results in stronger scientific inferences because it estimates and minimizes both Type I errors and relevant Type II errors for a test. It also results in greater transparency concerning assumptions about relevant effect size(s) and the relative costs of Type I and II errors. By contrast, the use of {$\alpha$} = 0.05 results in arbitrary decisions about what effect sizes will likely be considered significant, if real, and results in arbitrary amounts of Type II error for meaningful potential effect sizes. We cannot identify a rationale for continuing to arbitrarily use {$\alpha$} = 0.05 for null hypothesis significance tests in any field, when it is possible to determine an optimal {$\alpha$}.},

Closed form, finite series expressions do not exist for the distribution functions in either the null or non-null case (except for special cases). In practice, asymptotic approximations, based on F or chi square distributions, are used for the null case. It is not widely known that similarly accurate and general approximations have been published for the non-null case, for all except the largest root [15,38]. In this paper new approximations, based on noncentral F's, are provided for power for all but the largest root. These generalize existing F approximations for the central case. Much less calculation is needed than for earlier approximations and accuracy appears not to suffer in practice. An upper bound F approximation is provided for the largest root power. Power calculation can be used to help choose a test statistic as well as for experimental design. A particularly convenient method for estimating power, using standard linear models programs [20], is generalized to the multivariate case.},

Furthermore, the corresponding sequence of hypothesis tests will make only a finite number of errors with probability one, under mild regulatory conditions, including both i.i.d. and strongly mixing processes. It can be used as an alternative to arbitrary fixed significance levels such as 0.050.050.05 or 0.010.010.01. This approach resolves the Jeffreys-Lindley paradox. It is also robust to multiple comparisons, and to a lesser extent, optional stopping making it somewhat robust to data fishing or p-hacking. As an example of the practical applications of this technique, it is used as a lag order selection mechanism in simulations. It performs well relative to other model selection criteria. In another simulation, hypothesis tests and confidence intervals for the mean are investigated, demonstrating the improved performance even in small samples. We also show that under mild regularity conditions, any sequence of two-sided hypothesis tests with fixed significance level will make an infinite number of mistakes with positive probability.},

  abstract = {Inductive generalization, where people go beyond the data provided, is a basic cognitive capability, and it underpins theoretical accounts of learning, categorization, and decision making. To complete the inductive leap needed for generalization, people must make a key ``sampling'' assumption about how the available data were generated. Previous models have considered two extreme possibilities, known as strong and weak sampling. In strong sampling, data are assumed to have been deliberately generated as positive examples of a concept, whereas in weak sampling, data are assumed to have been generated without any restrictions. We develop a more general account of sampling that allows for an intermediate mixture of these two extremes, and we test its usefulness. In two experiments, we show that most people complete simple one-dimensional generalization tasks in a way that is consistent with their believing in some mixture of strong and weak sampling, but that there are large individual differences in the relative emphasis different people give to each type of sampling. We also show experimentally that the relative emphasis of the mixture is influenced by the structure of the available information. We discuss the psychological meaning of mixing strong and weak sampling, and possible extensions of our modeling approach to richer problems of inductive generalization.},

Researchers armed with only the sample sizes and p-values of the published findings can fully correct for publication bias.

The hope is that such a mechanism will stimulate the kinds of reconsideration, better information processing and decision making as has been found to be stimulated by authentic dissent. In a prior study comparing these two processes, devil's advocate appeared to foster thinking that was primarily aimed at cognitive bolstering of the initial viewpoint rather than stimulate divergent thought. While that study left the actual position of the DA unknown, the present study compared conditions where the devil's advocate position was known (and consistent or inconsistent with the assigned position) or unknown. It further utilized quantity and quality of solutions as a dependent measure rather than simply cognitive activity. Results indicated that the authentic minority was superior to all three forms of `devil's advocate,' again underscoring the value and importance of authenticity and the difficulty in cloning such authenticity by role-playing techniques.

  abstract = {A new method is presented for examining eÂ€ects of emotion in the detection of change in facial expression of emotion. The method was used in one experiment, reported here. Participants who were induced to feel happiness, sadness, or neutral emotion, saw computerized 100-frame movies in which the \textregistered rst frame always showed a face expressing a speci\textregistered c emotion (e.g. happiness). The facial expression gradually became neutral over the course of the movie. Participants played the movie, changing the facial expression, and indicated the frame at which the initial expression was no longer present on the face. Emotion congruent expressions were perceived to persist longer than were emotion incongruent expressions. The \textregistered ndings are consistent with previous \textregistered ndings documenting enhanced perceptual processing of emotion congruent information. The value of the current technique, and the types of everyday situations that it might model are discussed. Copyright \# 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Philosophical realism holds that the aim of a particular discourse is to make true statements about its subject-matter. Niiniluoto surveys the different varieties ofrealism in ontology, semantics, epistemology, theory construction, and methodology. He then sets out his own original version, and defends it against competing theories in the philosophy of science. Niiniluoto's critical scientific realism is founded upon the notion of truth as correspondencebetween language and reality, and characterizes scientific progress in terms of increasing truthlikeness. This makes it possible not only to take seriously, but also to make precise, the troublesome idea that scientific theories typically are false but nevertheless close to the truth.},

However, after watching a video of a simulated bank robbery, participants who verbally described the robber were 25\% worse at identifying the robber in a lineup than were participants who instead listed U.S. states and capitals\textemdash this has been termed the ``verbal overshadowing'' effect (Schooler \& Engstler-Schooler, 1990). More recent studies suggested that this effect might be substantially smaller than first reported. Given uncertainty about the effect size, the influence of this finding in the memory literature, and its practical importance for police procedures, we conducted two collections of preregistered direct replications (RRR1 and RRR2) that differed only in the order of the description task and a filler task. In RRR1, when the description task immediately followed the robbery, participants who provided a description were 4\% less likely to select the robber than were those in the control condition. In RRR2, when the description was delayed by 20 min, they were 16\% less likely to select the robber. These findings reveal a robust verbal overshadowing effect that is strongly influenced by the relative timing of the tasks. The discussion considers further implications of these replications for our understanding of verbal overshadowing.},

We also present a three-level model for the common case where, within studies, multiple effect sizes are calculated using the same sample. Whereas this approach is relatively simple and does not require imputing values for the unknown sampling covariances, it has hardly been used, and its performance has not been empirically investigated. Therefore, we set up a simulation study, showing that also in this situation, a three-level approach yields valid results: Estimates of the treatment effects and the corresponding standard errors are unbiased.},

  abstract = {Recently, evidence for endemically low statistical power has cast neuroscience findings into doubt. If low statistical power plagues neuroscience, then this reduces confidence in the reported effects. However, if statistical power is not uniformly low, then such blanket mistrust might not be warranted. Here, we provide a different perspective on this issue, analyzing data from an influential study reporting a median power of 21\% across 49 meta-analyses (). We demonstrate, using Gaussian mixture modeling, that the sample of 730 studies included in that analysis comprises several subcomponents so the use of a single summary statistic is insufficient to characterize the nature of the distribution. We find that statistical power is extremely low for studies included in meta-analyses that reported a null result and that it varies substantially across subfields of neuroscience, with particularly low power in candidate gene association studies. Therefore, whereas power in neuroscience remains a critical issue, the notion that studies are systematically underpowered is not the full story: low power is far from a universal problem., SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Recently, researchers across the biomedical and psychological sciences have become concerned with the reliability of results. One marker for reliability is statistical power: the probability of finding a statistically significant result given that the effect exists. Previous evidence suggests that statistical power is low across the field of neuroscience. Our results present a more comprehensive picture of statistical power in neuroscience: on average, studies are indeed underpowered\textemdash some very seriously so\textemdash but many studies show acceptable or even exemplary statistical power. We show that this heterogeneity in statistical power is common across most subfields in neuroscience. This new, more nuanced picture of statistical power in neuroscience could affect not only scientific understanding, but potentially policy and funding decisions for neuroscience research.},

The fault, argues this ingenious-even liberating-book, lies not in ourselves, but in product design that ignores the needs of users and the principles of cognitive psychology. The problems range from ambiguous and hidden controls to arbitrary relationships between controls and functions, coupled with a lack of feedback or other assistance and unreasonable demands on memorization. The Design of Everyday Things shows that good, usable design is possible. The rules are simple: make things visible, exploit natural relationships that couple function and control, and make intelligent use of constraints. The goal: guide the user effortlessly to the right action on the right control at the right time. In this entertaining and insightful analysis, cognitive scientist Don Norman hails excellence of design as the most important key to regaining the competitive edge in influencing consumer behavior. Now fully expanded and updated, with a new introduction by the author, The Design of Everyday Things is a powerful primer on how-and why-some products satisfy customers while others only frustrate them.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: A number of studies have computed the minimally important difference (MID) for health-related quality of life instruments.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether there is consistency in the magnitude of MID estimates from different instruments.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of the literature to identify studies that computed an MID and contained sufficient information to compute an effect size (ES). Thirty-eight studies fulfilled the criteria, resulting in 62 ESs.
RESULTS: For all but 6 studies, the MID estimates were close to one half a SD (mean = 0.495, SD = 0.155). There was no consistent relationship with factors such as disease-specific or generic instrument or the number of response options. Negative changes were not associated with larger ESs. Population-based estimation procedures and brief follow-up were associated with smaller ESs, and acute conditions with larger ESs. An explanation for this consistency is that research in psychology has shown that the limit of people's ability to discriminate over a wide range of tasks is approximately 1 part in 7, which is very close to half a SD.
CONCLUSION: In most circumstances, the threshold of discrimination for changes in health-related quality of life for chronic diseases appears to be approximately half a SD.},

  abstract = {Objective: To examine the relation between responsiveness coefficients derived directly from a calculation of average change resulting from a treatment intervention (Responsiveness-Treatment or RT) and those derived from retrospective analysis of changed and unchanged groups (Responsiveness Retrospective or RR) based on a global measure of change. Method: Two approaches were used. First, we used simulation methods to examine the analytical relationship between the RT and RR coefficients. We then located eight studies where it was possible to compute both RT and RR coefficients. As anticipated from theoretical arguments, the RR coefficients were larger than the RT coefficients (1.50 versus 0.41, p {$<$} .0001). Within study there was no predictable relationship between the two indices. Across studies, the magnitude of the RR coefficient was strongly related to the correlation with the retrospective global scale, and unrelated to the magnitude of the RT coefficient. The simulated curves fit well with the observed data, and substantiated the observation that the relation between RT and RR coefficients is complex and only weakly related to the size of the treatment effect. Conclusion: Retrospective methods of computing responsiveness yield little information about the ability of an instrument to detect treatment effects, and should not be used as a basis for choice of an instrument for applications to clinical trials.},

This distinction between postdiction and prediction is appreciated conceptually but is not respected in practice. Mistaking generation of postdictions with testing of predictions reduces the credibility of research findings. However, ordinary biases in human reasoning, such as hindsight bias, make it hard to avoid this mistake. An effective solution is to define the research questions and analysis plan before observing the research outcomes\textemdash a process called preregistration. Preregistration distinguishes analyses and outcomes that result from predictions from those that result from postdictions. A variety of practical strategies are available to make the best possible use of preregistration in circumstances that fall short of the ideal application, such as when the data are preexisting. Services are now available for preregistration across all disciplines, facilitating a rapid increase in the practice. Widespread adoption of preregistration will increase distinctiveness between hypothesis generation and hypothesis testing and will improve the credibility of research findings.},

In the present scientific culture, novel and positive results are considered more publishable than replications and negative results. This creates incentives to avoid or ignore replications and negative results, even at the expense of accuracy (Giner-Sorolla, 2012; Nosek, Spies, \& Motyl, 2012). As a consequence, replications (Makel, Plucker, \& Hegarty, 2012) and negative results (Fanelli, 2010; Sterling, 1959) are rare in the published literature. This insight is not new, but the culture is resistant to change. This article introduces the first known journal issue in any discipline consisting exclusively of preregistered replication studies. It demonstrates that replications have substantial value, and that incentives can be changed.},

(2) and elsewhere: ``Preregistering theoretical predictions enables theory falsifiability. Preregistering analysis plans enables type I error control.'' We appreciate that the comment elevates the complementary roles of prediction and analysis plans in preregistration. We disagree that they are conflated in the sense of being ``two types of preregistration.''

To enable theory falsification, we agree that a preregistration should offer a prediction derived from theory and provide the theoretical context. However, a prediction without an analysis plan is inert for falsification. An analysis plan is necessary to specify how the prediction will be tested with \ldots{}

We found that the typical effect size in this field was a Pearson's correlation of .26, and the median sample size was 60. We calculated the power of each primary study by using the corresponding meta-analytic effect as a proxy for the true effect. The median power across all studies was 48.8\%, with only 29.8\% of the studies reaching a power of 80\% or higher. We documented differences in average effect size and median power between different subfields in intelligence research (correlational studies, studies of group differences, experiments, toxicology, and behavior genetics). Across all meta-analyses, we found evidence for small study effects in meta-analyses, highlighting potential publication bias. The evidence for the small study effect being stronger for studies from the US than for non-US studies (a US effect) was weak at best. We found no clear evidence for the decline effect, early extremes effect, or citation bias across meta-analyses. Even though the power in intelligence research seems to be higher than in other fields of psychology, this field does not seem immune to the problems of replicability as documented in psychology.},

  abstract = {Repeated measures analyses of variance are the method of choice in many studies from experimental psychology and the neurosciences. Data from these fields are often characterized by small sample sizes, high numbers of factor levels of the within-subjects factor(s), and nonnormally distributed response variables such as response times. For a design with a single within-subjects factor, we investigated Type I error control in univariate tests with corrected degrees of freedom, the multivariate approach, and a mixed-model (multilevel) approach (SAS PROC MIXED) with Kenward\textendash Roger's adjusted degrees of freedom. We simulated multivariate normal and nonnormal distributions with varied population variance\textendash covariance structures (spherical and nonspherical), sample sizes (N), and numbers of factor levels (K). For normally distributed data, as expected, the univariate approach with Huynh\textendash Feldt correction controlled the Type I error rate with only very few exceptions, even if samples sizes as low as three were combined with high numbers of factor levels. The multivariate approach also controlled the Type I error rate, but it requires N {$\geq$} K. PROC MIXED often showed acceptable control of the Type I error rate for normal data, but it also produced several liberal or conservative results. For nonnormal data, all of the procedures showed clear deviations from the nominal Type I error rate in many conditions, even for sample sizes greater than 50. Thus, none of these approaches can be considered robust if the response variable is nonnormally distributed. The results indicate that both the variance heterogeneity and covariance heterogeneity of the population covariance matrices affect the error rates.},

  abstract = {Behavioral synchronization is one mechanism through which people coordinate their behavior in social interactions. Researchers from a wide range of scientific disciplines have examined the social antecedents and consequences of behavioral synchrony. At the core of this research lies the double assumption that people spontaneously synchronize their behavior during social interactions, and that synchronized movement rhythms transform individuals into a social unit. Recent experimental research has started to offer converging support for these theoretical ideas. In the present chapter, we will first define behavioral synchrony and review early research on movement synchrony. Subsequently, we discuss how behavioral synchrony is measured using frame-by-frame analysis, judgments of synchrony by observers, movement tracking devices or automatic motion analysis. We then provide an overview of recent studies on how synchrony emerges, focusing both on a dynamic systems perspective, as a cognitive perspective based on common coding theory. Finally, we review research on the consequences of behavioral synchrony, on the affective, behavioral and cognitive consequences of moving in synchrony. The research discussed in this chapter points towards the fundamental role synchrony plays in social interaction. The tendency to synchronize, together with the emergence of a social unit when individuals move in synchrony, seems to indicate that people have a predisposition to socially connect to others through mutual adaptation of behavioral rhythms.},

  abstract = {Theories of verisimilitude have routinely been classified into two rival camps\textemdash the content approach and the likeness approach\textemdash and these appear to be motivated by very different sets of data and principles. The question thus naturally arises as to whether these approaches can be fruitfully combined. Recently Zwart and Franssen (Synthese 158(1):75\textendash 92, 2007) have offered precise analyses of the content and likeness approaches, and shown that given these analyses any attempt to meld content and likeness orderings violates some basic desiderata. Unfortunately their characterizations of the approaches do not embrace the paradigm examples of those approaches. I offer somewhat different characterizations of these two approaches, as well as of the consequence approach (Schurz and Weingartner (Synthese 172(3):415\textendash 436, 2010) which happily embrace their respective paradigms. Finally I prove that the three approaches are indeed compatible, but only just, and that the cost of combining them is too high. Any account which combines the strictures of what I call the strong likeness approach with the demands of either the content or the consequence approach suffers from precisely the same defect as Popper's\textemdash namely, it entails the trivialization of truthlikeness. The downside of eschewing the strong likeness constraints and embracing the content constraints alone is the underdetermination of the concept of truthlikeness.},

  abstract = {The idea that in behavioural research everything correlates with everything else was a niche area of the scientific literature for over half a century. With the increasing availability of large datasets in psychology, and the heightened interest in falsifiability and null results, the `crud' factor has however become more relevant than ever before. It is referenced routinely by researchers to discount minute \textendash{} but statistically significant \textendash{} effects that they deem too small to be considered meaningful. This review tracks the history of the crud factor and examines how its use in the scientific literature has developed to this day. It highlights a common and deep-seated lack of understanding about what the crud factor is, whether it can be proven to exist or estimated, and how it should be interpreted. This makes the crud factor a convenient tool for psychologists to disregard unwanted results, even though the presence of a crud factor should be a large inconvenience for the discipline. To inspire a concerted effort to take the crud factor more seriously, this review clarifies the definitions of important concepts, highlights current pitfalls and poses questions that need to be addressed to ultimately improve our understanding of the crud factor. Such work will be necessary to develop the crud factor into a useful concept encouraging improved psychological research and theory corroboration practices.},

The first model was developed on the basis of the colour emotions, clean\textendash dirty, tense\textendash relaxed, and heavy\textendash light. In this model colour preference was found affected most by the emotional feeling ``clean.'' The second model was developed on the basis of the three colour-emotion factors identified in Part I, colour activity, colour weight, and colour heat. By combining this model with the colour-science-based formulae of these three factors, which have been developed in Part I, one can predict colour preference of a test colour from its colour-appearance attributes. The third colour preference model was directly developed from colour-appearance attributes. In this model colour preference is determined by the colour difference between a test colour and the reference colour (L*, a*, b*) = (50, -8, 30). The above approaches to modeling single-colour preference were also adopted in modeling colour preference for colour combinations. The results show that it was difficult to predict colour-combination preference by colour emotions only. This study also clarifies the relationship between colour preference and colour harmony. The results show that although colour preference is strongly correlated with colour harmony, there are still colours of which the two scales disagree with each other. \textcopyright{} 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  abstract = {Respiration and heart rates were recorded in normal subjects watching effortful actions produced by an actor in front of them. Subjects remained immobile throughout. Two experiments were performed. In experiment 1, subjects watched a weight-lifting performance, either static or dynamic, with increasing weights. In experiment 2, they watched a walking / running performance on a treadmill moving at increasing speed. In both experiments, no change was found in observers' heart rate. By contrast, consistent changes were found in respiration rate. These changes tended to follow the exercise rhythm of the actor, specially during accelerated running (from 2.5 to 10 km / h) where respiration rate increased linearly with speed of the treadmill.

  abstract = {Bringing together recent work on body perception from cognitive neuroscience and social psychological research on social relations, we tested the hypothesis that a synchronous multisensory stimulation leads to self-other merging. We brushed the cheek of participants while they watched a stranger being brushed in the same way either in synchrony or asynchrony. This multisensory procedure had an effect both on body and social perception. Compared to asynchronous stimulation, synchronous stimulation led to more self-other merging in terms of body sensations and face resemblance, and also to self-other merging in terms of inner states, closeness and conformity behavior. The present research shows how multisensory integration can affect social perception and create a sense of self-other similarity.},

  abstract = {The determination of statistical power for a repeated measures experimental study is a necessary, but difficult and seldom done, calculation. The purpose of this study was to provide practical methods for the a priori determination of power for the repeated measures (RM) analysis of variance (ANOVA). Stepwise regression analysis procedures were used to derive 10 power approximation equations for the main and interaction effects of the 1-way RM, 2-way mixed and 2-way RM ANOVA designs. The theoretically correct power values were calculated using the program DATASIM (Bradley, 1988) for various levels of effect size, number of levels of each factor, sample size, and mean correlations among RM factor levels. Potvin and Schutz's (in press) equations for estimating the error variance were utilized for computing power for the 2-way RM ANOVA. The derived equations showed a high level of precision in approximating power (R2 = .97 to .99, SEE = .0 12 to .035) with 9 to 16 predictor variables for the 1-way RM and the 2-way mixed designs. For the 2-way RM design, however, the levels of precision were relatively low for the main effect (R2 = .66 and .81 for {$\alpha$} levels .01 and .05, respectively), and the residuals of the regression equation for the interaction effect showed a nonlinear relation with the criterion variable. Recommendations are given for the practical usage of the derived equations, and examples for calculating power for each design are provided.},

  abstract = {Science policy issues have recently joined technology issues in being acknowledged to have strategic importance for national `competitiveness' and `economic security'. The economics literature addressed specifically to science and its interdependences with technological progress has been quite narrowly focused and has lacked an overarching conceptual framework to guide empirical studies and public policy discussions in this area. The emerging `new economics of science', described by this paper, offers a way to remedy these deficiencies. It makes use of insights from the theory of games of incomplete information to synthesize the classic approach of Arrow and Nelson in examining the implications of the characteristics of information for allocative efficiency in research activities, on the one hand, with the functionalist analysis of institutional structures, reward systems and behavioral norms of `open science' communities-associated with the sociology of science in the tradition of Merton-on the other. An analysis is presented of the gross features of the institutions and norms distinguishing open science from other modes of organizing scientific research, which shows that the collegiate reputation-based reward system functions rather well in satisfying the requirement of social efficiency in increasing the stock of reliable knowledge. At a more fine-grain level of examination, however, the detailed workings of the system based on the pursuit of priority are found to cause numerous inefficiencies in the allocation of basic and applied science resources, both within given fields and programs and across time. Another major conclusion, arrived at in the context of examining policy measures and institutional reforms proposed to promote knowledge transfers between university-based open science and commercial R\&D, is that there are no economic forces that operate automatically to maintain dynamic efficiency in the interactions of these two (organizational) spheres. Ill-considered institutional experiments, which destroy their distinctive features if undertaken on a sufficient scale, may turn out to be very costly in terms of long-term economic performance.},

However, the literature on the field contains a bewildering array of findings, and empirical progress has not been matched by consensus on major theoretical issues. The Psychology of Attention presents a systematic review of the main lines of research on attention; the topics range from perception of threshold stimuli to memory storage and decision making. The book develops empirical generalizations about the major issues and suggests possible underlying theoretical principles. Pashler argues that widely assumed notions of processing resources and automaticity are of limited value in understanding human information processing. He proposes a central bottleneck for decision making and memory retrieval, and describes evidence that distinguishes this limitation from perceptual limitations and limited-capacity short-term memory.},

In-phase coordination was performed under manipulations of phase detuning and movement frequency and either singly or in combination with an arithmetic task. Predicted direction-specific shifts in stable relative phase from 0\textdegree{} due to detuning and movement frequency were amplified by the cognitive task. Nonlinear cross-recurrence analysis suggested that this cognitive influence on the locations of the stable points or attractors of coordination entailed a magnification of attractor noise without a reduction in attractor strength. An approximation to these findings was achieved through parameter changes in a motion equation in relative phase. Results are discussed in terms of dual-task performance as limited resources, dynamics rather than chronometrics, and reparameterization rather than degradation.},

  abstract = {The effects of tempo and role (fast vs. slow hand) on the reciprocal interaction (strength of coupling) between two hands tapping a 2: 3 polyrhythm were examined from the perspective of nonlinear oscillator theory. A measure of the degree of harmonicity was developed, based on the relative contribution of the tapping frequency to the power spectrum of the limit cycle phase angle of each individual hand. On the assumption of fixed coefficients of the dissipative terms in the component oscillators, comparison of unimanual and bimanual performance with respect to this measure allowed for examination of the effects of the experimental conditions on the strength of the coupling. Five right-handed skilled drummers performed the 2: 3 polyrhythm at several tempos and with both hand arrangements (i.e., either the preferred or the non-preferred hand tapped the faster cadence). The analysis revealed an inverse relation between tempo and coupling strength, and a larger influence of the fast hand on the slow hand than vice versa. No differences, were observed between the two hand arrangements. The theoretical implications of these results were discussed in relation to similar and dissimilar findings in the literature.},

  abstract = {Our purpose, is to put forward a change in the paradigm of testing by generalizing a very natural idea exposed by Morris DeGroot (1975) aiming to an approach that is attractive to all schools of statistics, in a procedure better suited for the needs of science. DeGroot's seminal idea is to base testing statistical hypothesis on minimizing the weighted sum of type I plus type II error instead of of the prevailing paradigm which is fixing type I error and minimizing type II error. DeGroot's result is that in simple vs simple hypothesis the optimal criterion is to reject, according to the likelihood ratio as the evidence (ordering) statistics using a fixed threshold value, instead of a fixed tail probability. By defining expected type I and type II errors, we generalize DeGroot's approach and find that the optimal region is defined by the ratio of evidences, that is, averaged likelihoods (with respect to a prior measure) and a threshold fixed. This approach yields an optimal theory in complete generality, which the Classical Theory of Testing does not. This can be seen as a Bayes-Non-Bayes compromise: the criteria (weighted sum of type I and type II errors) is Frequentist, but the test criterion is the ratio of marginalized likelihood, which is Bayesian. We give arguments, to push the theory still further, so that the weighting measures (priors)of the likelihoods does not have to be proper and highly informative, but just predictively matched, that is that predictively matched priors, give rise to the same evidence (marginal likelihoods) using minimal (smallest) training samples. The theory that emerges, similar to the theories based on Objective Bayes approaches, is a powerful response to criticisms of the prevailing approach of hypothesis testing, see for example Ioannidis (2005) and Siegfried (2010) among many others.},

  abstract = {[In the past two decades, striking examples of allegedly inferior likelihood ratio tests (LRT) have appeared in the statistical literature. These examples, which arise in multiparameter hypothesis testing problems, have several common features. In each case the null hypothesis is composite, the size {$\alpha$} LRT is not similar and hence biased, and competing size {$\alpha$} tests can be constructed that are less biased, or even unbiased, and that dominate the LRT in the sense of being everywhere more powerful. It is therefore asserted that in these examples and, by implication, many other testing problems, the LR criterion produces "inferior," "deficient," "undesirable," or "flawed" statistical procedures. This message, which appears to be proliferating, is wrong. In each example it is the allegedly superior test that is flawed, not the LRT. At worst, the "superior" tests provide unwarranted and inappropriate inferences and have been deemed scientifically unacceptable by applied statisticians. This reinforces the well-documented but oft-neglected fact that the Neyman-Pearson theory desideratum of a more (or most) powerful size {$\alpha$} test may be scientifically inappropriate; the same is true for the criteria of unbiasedness and {$\alpha$}-admissibility. Although the LR criterion is not infallible, we believe that it remains a generally reasonable first option for non-Bayesian parametric hypothesis-testing problems.]},

This contribution aims to remind readers what power analysis is, emphasize why it matters, and articulate when and how it should be used. The focus is on applications of power analysis for experimental designs often encountered in psychology, starting from simple two-group independent and paired groups and moving to one-way analysis of variance, factorial designs, contrast analysis, trend analysis, regression analysis, analysis of covariance, and mediation analysis. Special attention is given to the application of power analysis to moderation designs, considering both dichotomous and continuous predictors and moderators. Illustrative practical examples based on G*Power and R packages are provided throughout the article. Annotated code for the examples with R and dedicated computational tools are made freely available at a dedicated web page (https://github.com/mcfanda/primerPowerIRSP). Applications of power analysis for more complex designs are briefly mentioned, and some important general issues related to power analysis are discussed.},

  abstract = {A publication deluge has impeded rather than advanced theory in experimental psychology. Many researchers rely more on null-hypothesis significance testing than literature studies to determine whether results are worthwhile. Four problematic publication practices are symptomatic for the theoretical deficit: (a) reinventing the wheel, (b) the Proteus phenomenon, (c) mechanical (non) replications, and (d) the survival of discredited hypotheses. Remedies include the development of AI tools recommending semantically related references, mandatory hypothesizing before and after results are known, and theoretical syntheses guided by meta-analyses and process models. The nonlinear theoretical development shows parallels to the optimization procedure of biological evolution. Theoretical hypotheses rather than experimental results are the elementary units of science. The fittest theories may survive alongside the least fit because they are not made to compete in research publications. Even if publication practices improve, winning hypotheses will often represent local optima and still cannot be taken with absolute certainty.},

  abstract = {Traditional mechanistic accounts of language processing derive almost entirely from the study of monologue. Yet, the most natural and basic form of language use is dialogue. As a result, these accounts may only offer limited theories of the mechanisms that underlie language processing in general. We propose a mechanistic account of dialogue, the interactive alignment account, and use it to derive a number of predictions about basic language processes. The account assumes that, in dialogue, the linguistic representations employed by the interlocutors become aligned at many levels, as a result of a largely automatic process. This process greatly simplifies production and comprehension in dialogue. After considering the evidence for the interactive alignment model, we concentrate on three aspects of processing that follow from it. It makes use of a simple interactive inference mechanism, enables the development of local dialogue routines that greatly simplify language processing, and explains the origins of self-monitoring in production. We consider the need for a grammatical framework that is designed to deal with language in dialogue rather than monologue, and discuss a range of implications of the account.},

However, there remains considerable disagreement among scientists about how best to sanction data fraud, and about the ethicality of selective reporting. The public is arguably the largest stakeholder in the reproducibility of science; research is primarily paid for with public funds, and flawed science threatens the public's welfare. Members of the public are able to make meaningful judgments about the morality of different behaviors using moral intuitions. Legal scholars emphasize that to maintain legitimacy, social control policies must be developed with some consideration given to the public's moral intuitions. Although there is a large literature on popular attitudes toward science, there is no existing evidence about public opinion on data fraud or selective reporting. We conducted two studies\textemdash a survey experiment with a nationwide convenience sample (N = 821), and a follow-up survey with a representative sample of US adults (N = 964)\textemdash to explore community members' judgments about the morality of data fraud and selective reporting in science. The findings show that community members make a moral distinction between data fraud and selective reporting, but overwhelmingly judge both behaviors to be immoral and deserving of punishment. Community members believe that scientists who commit data fraud or selective reporting should be fired and banned from receiving funding. For data fraud, most Americans support criminal penalties. Results from an ordered logistic regression analysis reveal few demographic and no significant partisan differences in punitiveness toward data fraud.},

We observed considerable overlap in the neural substrates of the three comparison tasks. Interestingly, the amount of overlap predicted the amount of cross-dimensional interference: in both behavior and fMRI, number interfered with size, and size with luminance, but number did not interfere with luminance. The results suggest that during comparative judgments, the relevant continuous quantities are represented in distributed and overlapping neural populations, with number and size engaging a common parietal spatial code, while size and luminance engage shared occipito-temporal perceptual representations.},

The main objective of this study was to determine the effect of the correlation between the levels in one RM factor on the power of the other RM factor. Monte Carlo simulation procedures were used to estimate power for the A, B, and AB tests of a 2\texttimes 3, a 2\texttimes 6, a 2\texttimes 9, a 3\texttimes 3, a 3\texttimes 6, and a 3\texttimes 9 design under varying experimental conditions of effect size (small, medium, and large), average correlation (.4 and .8), alpha (.01 and .05), and sample size (n = 5, 10 ,15, 20, 25, and 30). Results indicated that the greater the magnitude of the differences between the average correlation among the levels of Factor A and the average correlation in the AB matrix, the lower the power for Factor B (and vice versa). Equations for estimating the error variance of each test of the two-way model were constructed by examining power and mean square error trends across different correlation matrices. Support for the accuracy of these formulae is given, thus allowing for direct analytic power calculations in future studies.},

  abstract = {There is disagreement in the literature about the exact nature of the phenomenon of empathy. There are emotional, cognitive, and conditioning views, applying in varying degrees across species. An adequate description of the ultimate and proximate mechanism can integrate these views. Proximately, the perception of an object's state activates the subject's corresponding representations, which in turn activate somatic and autonomic responses. This mechanism supports basic behaviors (e.g., alarm, social facilitation, vicariousness of emotions, mother-infant responsiveness, and the modeling of competitors and predators) that are crucial for the reproductive success of animals living in groups. The Perception-Action Model (PAM), together with an understanding of how representations change with experience, can explain the major empirical effects in the literature (similarity, familiarity, past experience, explicit teaching, and salience). It can also predict a variety of empathy disorders. The interaction between the PAM and prefrontal functioning can also explain different levels of empathy across species and age groups. This view can advance our evolutionary understanding of empathy beyond inclusive fitness and reciprocal altruism and can explain different levels of empathy across individuals, species, stages of development, and situations.},

Other effects do not reach the threshold of statistical significance and are sometimes described as ``marginally significant'' or as ``approaching significance.'' Although the concept of marginal significance is widely deployed in academic psychology, there has been very little systematic examination of psychologists' attitudes toward these effects. Here, we report an observational study in which we investigated psychologists' attitudes concerning marginal significance by examining their language in over 1,500 articles published in top-tier cognitive, developmental, and social psychology journals. We observed a large change over the course of four decades in psychologists' tendency to describe a p value as marginally significant, and overall rates of use appear to differ across subfields. We discuss possible explanations for these findings, as well as their implications for psychological research.},

  abstract = {Three experiments examined the influence of distance between response keys (and hands) on the Stroop effect obtained for two-choice tasks in which stimulus colors were identified with keypresses. The Stroop effect was larger when the response locations were close together than when they were far apart, replicating a previous finding. Although this result was obtained only in the initial 30 trials, it was evident in a between-subject design as well as a within-subject design. With more practice, the Stroop effect was of similar size for the close and far separation conditions. Also, when the keys were close together, the Stroop effect was of similar size regardless of whether they were actuated by fingers from one or two hands, providing evidence against anatomical discriminability as a critical factor. Finally, the Stroop effect was numerically larger when the close keys were pressed by sticks held at the far separation than when the far keys were pressed by sticks held at the close separation, implicating distance between the keys rather than the hands as the main factor. The initially larger Stroop effect in RT for close keys could be due to lower spatial discriminability or to an accuracy bias in response thresholds, as suggested by the finding that it was accompanied by a numerically smaller effect in percent error.},

In his book, Stathis Psillos gives us a detailed and comprehensive study, which restores the intuitive plausibility of scientific realism. We see that throughout the twentieth century, scientific realism has been challenged by philosophical positions from all angles: from reductive empiricism, to instrumentalism and modern skeptical empiricism. Scientific Realism explains that the history of science does not undermine the notion of scientific realism, and instead makes it reasonable to accept scientific as the best philosophical account of science, its empirical success, its progress and its practice. Anyone wishing to gain a deeper understanding of the state of modern science and why scientific realism is plausible, should read this book.},

Eavesdropping ability was defined as lower sensitivity to cues of the face, a source of overtly displayed emotions, relative to sensitivity to cues of the body, a source of ``leakage'' of covert or hidden emotions. Results showed that actors felt less rapport the higher their partner's eavesdropping. High neuroticism actors were especially likely to feel worse about their interaction and themselves when their partners were good at eavesdropping. In both instances, the eavesdropper's nonverbal behavior seems to have mediated the associations to a small degree.},

  doi = {10.1186/s13075-015-0658-6},
  abstract = {A minimal clinically important difference (MCID) is an important concept used to determine whether a medical intervention improves perceived outcomes in patients. Prior to the introduction of the concept in 1989, studies focused primarily on statistical significance. As most recent clinical trials in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have failed to show significant effects, determining a clinically relevant threshold for outcome scores (that is, the MCID) of existing instruments may be critical for conducting and interpreting meaningful clinical trials as well as for facilitating the establishment of treatment recommendations for patients. To that effect, methods to determine the MCID can be divided into two well-defined categories: distribution-based and anchor-based approaches. Distribution-based approaches are based on statistical characteristics of the obtained samples. There are various methods within the distribution-based approach, including the standard error of measurement, the standard deviation, the effect size, the minimal detectable change, the reliable change index, and the standardized response mean. Anchor-based approaches compare the change in a patient-reported outcome to a second, external measure of change (that is, one that is more clearly understood, such as a global assessment), which serves as the anchor. Finally, the Delphi technique can be applied as an adjunct to defining a clinically important difference. Despite an abundance of methods reported in the literature, little work in MCID estimation has been done in the context of SLE. As the MCID can help determine the effect of a given therapy on a patient and add meaning to statistical inferences made in clinical research, we believe there ought to be renewed focus on this area. Here, we provide an update on the use of MCIDs in clinical research, review some of the work done in this area in SLE, and propose an agenda for future research.},

We predict that benefits are most likely to occur in forced play scenarios and in situations where punishment is the only means to convey an individual's cooperative intent and willingness to uphold fairness norms. By contrast, if partner choice is possible and an individual's cooperative intent can be inferred directly, then individuals with a nonpunishing cooperative reputation should typically be preferred over punishing cooperators.},

Whereas the conventional approach requires patients to judge themselves relative to their memories, our method requires patients to judge themselves relative to others with the same condition. In this study we examined whether our method (based on between-patient differences) and the conventional method (based on within-patient changes) provides comparable estimates of the MID for one health status measure: the Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire. Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who were participating in a supervised respiratory rehabilitation program were included if they were in stable health (n = 112). Their mean score per question in the Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire was 4.5 (range, 1 to 7; where bigger values indicate better health). Our method estimated that the MID was 0.5 (95\% confidence interval 0.4 to 0.7). This estimate was similar to the MID previously found using the conventional method. These observations support the role of the Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire for measuring patient's symptoms, the validity of our approach for assessing the MID, and an estimate on the order of 0.5 as the threshold for this particular health status measure.},

Some of these rumors appear so frequently, and in such complex, colorful, and entertaining ways that we can think of them as academic urban legends. The explanation for this phenomenon is usually that authors have lazily, sloppily, or fraudulently employed sources, and peer reviewers and editors have not discovered these weaknesses in the manuscripts during evaluation. To illustrate this phenomenon, I draw upon a remarkable case in which a decimal point error appears to have misled millions into believing that spinach is a good nutritional source of iron. Through this example, I demonstrate how an academic urban legend can be conceived and born, and can continue to grow and reproduce within academia and beyond.},

Data were generated from 2 models with 2\textendash 7 categories, 4 sample sizes, 2 latent distributions, and 5 patterns of category thresholds. Results revealed that factor loadings and robust standard errors were generally most accurately estimated using cat-LS, especially with fewer than 5 categories; however, factor correlations and model fit were assessed equally well with ML. Cat-LS was found to be more sensitive to sample size and to violations of the assumption of normality of the underlying continuous variables. Normal theory ML was found to be more sensitive to asymmetric category thresholds and was especially biased when estimating large factor loadings. Accordingly, we recommend cat-LS for data sets containing variables with fewer than 5 categories and ML when there are 5 or more categories, sample size is small, and category thresholds are approximately symmetric. With 6 \textendash 7 categories, results were similar across methods for many conditions; in these cases, either method is acceptable.},

It is suggested that geladas do synchronize their voices by using precise temporal and rhythmical controls on the outputs of their voices that are analogous to the temporal and rhythmical abilities humans use in many of the supra-segmental aspects of speech.},

  abstract = {Objective:Overactive performance monitoring, as measured by the error-related negativity in the event-related brain potential, represents one of the most robust psychophysiological alterations in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). It has been proposed as an endophenotype for OCD because it is heritable and more prevalent in families of OCD patients. Consistent with this notion, it is also independent of symptom profile and symptom severity in cross-sectional studies. Longitudinally, it has been shown to be state independent in pediatric patients with OCD. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the state dependency of error monitoring by examining adult OCD patients before and after symptom reduction through cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT).Method:Error-related and correct-related negativity as electrophysiological indicators of performance monitoring were recorded from 45 OCD patients and 39 healthy comparison subjects while performing a flanker task. Patients were assessed before starting and after completing a standard 30-session CBT, including exposure and response prevention, and healthy comparison subjects were tested after a comparable time interval.Results:Pretreatment, patients with OCD were characterized by enhanced error-related and correct-related negativity compared with healthy comparison subjects. This difference persisted after treatment when symptoms were substantially reduced. There was no significant correlation between symptom improvement and changes in performance monitoring and no difference in performance monitoring between treatment responders and nonresponders.Conclusions:This is the first longitudinal study in adult OCD patients showing stability of enhanced error monitoring following successful symptom reduction through CBT. It supports the hypothesis that overactive performance monitoring is an endophenotype that indicates vulnerability for OCD.},

  abstract = {When simultaneously testing multiple hypotheses, the usual approach in the context of confirmatory clinical trials is to control the familywise error rate (FWER), which bounds the probability of making at least one false rejection. In many trial settings, these hypotheses will additionally have a hierarchical structure that reflects the relative importance and links between different clinical objectives. The graphical approach of Bretz et al (2009) is a flexible and easily communicable way of controlling the FWER while respecting complex trial objectives and multiple structured hypotheses. However, the FWER can be a very stringent criterion that leads to procedures with low power, and may not be appropriate in exploratory trial settings. This motivates controlling generalized error rates, particularly when the number of hypotheses tested is no longer small. We consider the generalized familywise error rate (k-FWER), which is the probability of making k or more false rejections, as well as the tail probability of the false discovery proportion (FDP), which is the probability that the proportion of false rejections is greater than some threshold. We also consider asymptotic control of the false discovery rate, which is the expectation of the FDP. In this article, we show how to control these generalized error rates when using the graphical approach and its extensions. We demonstrate the utility of the resulting graphical procedures on three clinical trial case studies.},

  abstract = {Understanding complex natural systems requires approaches with minimal statistical limitations and biases. Previously, however, the fields of behaviour, ecology and evolution generally have been restricted to evaluating differences between statistical distributions. This framework can be very powerful. Unfortunately, it has also created a bias in these, and many other, fields towards publications focusing only on phenomena for which there are statistically significant differences. However, there is a wide range of questions that would benefit from reversing the existing paradigm and testing, instead, for equivalence. We have adapted the two one-sided test (TOST), also known as equivalence testing, from pharmaceutical science to be applicable to behavioural and ecological studies. We created a repeated measures analysis that allows researchers to statistically examine similarities between distributions. We compared song structure in male and female eastern bluebirds, Sialia sialis, as a case study for this method. We failed to find significant differences between male and female songs via a more traditional test, repeated measures ANOVA. Therefore, no definitive conclusion could be drawn about the similarities or differences in song structure. However, our repeated measures equivalence test showed that, based on five standard measures of song variation, male and female eastern bluebirds sing statistically equivalent songs. Our study highlights the presence of complex female song in a temperate songbird species. Additionally, we provide a new statistical test useful for expanding the statistical toolbox to assess new behavioural and ecological questions, and to help counteract publication bias in our fields.},

  abstract = {Open peer review (OPR) is a cornerstone of the emergent Open Science agenda. Yet to date no large-scale survey of attitudes towards OPR amongst academic editors, authors, reviewers and publishers has been undertaken. This paper presents the findings of an online survey, conducted for the OpenAIRE2020 project during September and October 2016, that sought to bridge this information gap in order to aid the development of appropriate OPR approaches by providing evidence about attitudes towards and levels of experience with OPR. The results of this cross-disciplinary survey, which received 3,062 full responses, show the majority (60.3\%) of respondents to be believe that OPR as a general concept should be mainstream scholarly practice (although attitudes to individual traits varied, and open identities peer review was not generally favoured). Respondents were also in favour of other areas of Open Science, like Open Access (88.2\%) and Open Data (80.3\%). Among respondents we observed high levels of experience with OPR, with three out of four (76.2\%) reporting having taken part in an OPR process as author, reviewer or editor. There were also high levels of support for most of the traits of OPR, particularly open interaction, open reports and final-version commenting. Respondents were against opening reviewer identities to authors, however, with more than half believing it would make peer review worse. Overall satisfaction with the peer review system used by scholarly journals seems to strongly vary across disciplines. Taken together, these findings are very encouraging for OPR's prospects for moving mainstream but indicate that due care must be taken to avoid a ``one-size fits all'' solution and to tailor such systems to differing (especially disciplinary) contexts. OPR is an evolving phenomenon and hence future studies are to be encouraged, especially to further explore differences between disciplines and monitor the evolution of attitudes.},

  abstract = {Based on the assumption that binary classification tasks are often processed asymmetrically (figure-ground asymmetries), two experiments showed that association alone cannot account for effects observed in the Implicit Association Test (IAT). Experiment 1 (N = 16) replicated a standard version of the IAT effect using old vs. young names as target categories and good and bad words as attribute categories. However, reliable compatibility effects were also found for a modified version of the task in which neutral words vs. nonwords instead of good vs. bad words were used as attribute categories. In Experiment 2 (N = 8), a reversed IAT effect was observed after the figure-ground asymmetry in the target dimension had been inverted by a previous go/nogo detection task in which participants searched for exemplars of the category ``young." The experiments support the hypothesis that figure-ground asymmetries produce compatibility effects in the IAT and suggest that IAT effects do not rely exclusively on evaluative associations between the target and attribute categories.},

We show here that the distortions are not in inference but in interpretation. Their claim is about what happens when the analyst's models do not match the data generating models, that is, the Bayes factor for models not specified. Given that we never know the underlying data generation mechanism we ask researcher to interpret Bayes factors for what they are---the relative strength of evidence from data for two hypotheticals.   We discuss how researchers should assess the robustness of their results by considering reasonable variation in model specification conditional on observed data rather than on hypothetical truths.},

Here, we illustrate how such methods can lead to a much more detailed understanding of group differences than bar graphs and t?tests on means. To complement the neuroscientist's toolbox, we present two powerful tools that can help us understand how groups of observations differ: the shift function and the difference asymmetry function. These tools can be combined with detailed visualisations to provide complementary perspectives about the data. We provide implementations in R and MATLAB of the graphical tools, and all the examples in the article can be reproduced using R scripts.},

Statistics has long neglected this principle, resulting in a seriously defective methodology. This book redresses the balance, explaining why science has clung to a defective methodology despite its well-known defects. After examining the strengths and weaknesses of the work of Neyman and Pearson and the Fisher paradigm, the author proposes an alternative paradigm which provides, in the law of likelihood, the explicit concept of evidence missing from the other paradigms. At the same time, this new paradigm retains the elements of objective measurement and control of the frequency of misleading results, features which made the old paradigms so important to science. The likelihood paradigm leads to statistical methods that have a compelling rationale and an elegant simplicity,  no longer forcing the reader to choose between frequentist and Bayesian statistics.},

Academic psychology has flourished with its mastery of the hypothesis-experiment model of science and its expertise in generating and eliminating alternative hypotheses and isolating causation. These accomplishments are a critical part of psychology, and they are well and appropriately taught by psychologists. However, they are only a part of science and should not comprise the almost exclusive criteria for evaluating research. In particular, discovery of fundamental phenomena, such as functional relations that apply to the real world and have generality, should have a higher priority in psychology. Such findings have been the basis for theoretical advances in other natural sciences.},

A methodological consideration that is often underappreciated is how to operationalize equivalence. This study examined whether a distribution-based approach, based on effect size, can identify an appropriate equivalence threshold for medical education data. Thirty-nine individuals rated program site equivalence on a series of simulated pairwise bar graphs representing one of four measures with which they had prior experience: (1) undergraduate academic achievement, (2) a student experience survey, (3) an Objective Structured Clinical Exam global rating scale, or (4) a licensing exam. Descriptive statistics and repeated measures ANOVA examined the effects on equivalence ratings of (a) the difference between means, (b) variability in scores, and (c) which program site (the larger or smaller) scored higher. The equivalence threshold was defined as the point at which 50 \% of participants rated the sites as non-equivalent. Across the four measures, the equivalence thresholds converged to average effect size of Cohen's d = 0.57 (range of 0.50-0.63). This corresponded to an average mean difference of 10 \% (range of 3-13 \%). These results are discussed in reference to findings from the health-related quality of life field that has demonstrated that d = 0.50 represents a consistent threshold for perceived change. This study provides preliminary empirically-based guidance for defining an equivalence threshold for researchers and evaluators conducting equivalence tests.},

First, we suggest that authors should only use a one-tailed test if they can explain why they are more interested in an effect in one direction and not the other. 4. We suggest a further requirement that adoption of one-tailed testing requires an explanation why the authors would treat a large observed difference in the unexpected direction no differently from a difference in the expected direction that was not strong enough to justify rejection of the null hypothesis. 5. These justifications should be included in published works that use one-tailed tests, allowing editors, reviewers and readers the ability to evaluate the appropriateness of the adoption of one-tailed testing. 6. We feel that adherence to our suggestions will allow authors to use one-tailed tests more appropriately, and readers to form their own opinion about such appropriateness when one-tailed tests are used.},

Departing from an interdependency perspective, we predict the activation of shared action representations even in hostile, competitive situations as a result of attending to the intentions of the co-actor. To test this, in Experiment 1 we manipulated the interdependency between actor and co-actor in a joint Simon task and observed a stronger activation of shared action representations in a cooperative as well as competitive context compared to an independent context. Experiment 2 replicated the competitive context effect on activation of shared action representations and provided additional evidence for the mediating role of attending to others' intentions by taking into account the individual tendency to attend to others' intentions. Together, our findings suggest that interdependency merges people's behavior even in competitive contexts, which we argue encourage actors to attend to others' intentions.},

Results revealed that the participants who learned the relative meaning of the artificial dimensionaladjectivesalso formed categories and developed a semantic congruity effect regardless of the characteristics of training.

  abstract = {A scientist's choice of research problem affects his or her personal career trajectory. Scientists' combined choices affect the direction and efficiency of scientific discovery as a whole. In this paper, we infer preferences that shape problem selection from patterns of published findings and then quantify their efficiency. We represent research problems as links between scientific entities in a knowledge network. We then build a generative model of discovery informed by qualitative research on scientific problem selection. We map salient features from this literature to key network properties: an entity's importance corresponds to its degree centrality, and a problem's difficulty corresponds to the network distance it spans. Drawing on millions of papers and patents published over 30 years, we use this model to infer the typical research strategy used to explore chemical relationships in biomedicine. This strategy generates conservative research choices focused on building up knowledge around important molecules. These choices become more conservative over time. The observed strategy is efficient for initial exploration of the network and supports scientific careers that require steady output, but is inefficient for science as a whole. Through supercomputer experiments on a sample of the network, we study thousands of alternatives and identify strategies much more efficient at exploring mature knowledge networks. We find that increased risk-taking and the publication of experimental failures would substantially improve the speed of discovery. We consider institutional shifts in grant making, evaluation, and publication that would help realize these efficiencies.},

We relate the expected p value (EPV) under the alternative to the more familiar concepts of significance level and power. We then go on to argue that in cases where it is difficult to evaluate the power function, the EPV can be used as a measure of the performance of a test. EPV's are always easily evaluated or simulated. Different test statistics for the same hypotheses can also be compared by means of EPV's. We carry out such a comparison between the two-sample, one-sided Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Mann-Whitney, and t tests, for a variety of underlying distributions. The EPV can also be a valuable tool in sample size determination and in the interpretation of observed p values. We hope to convince practitioners of the usefulness of EPV's.},

This may transform a disappointing dataset into a publishable study, but it does so at the cost of increasing the Type I error rate. How big of a problem is this, and what can we do about it? To answer the first question, we estimate the Type I error inflation based on the initial sample size, the number of participants used to augment the dataset, the critical value for determining significance (typically .05), and the maximum p value within the initial sample such that the dataset would be augmented. With one round of augmentation, Type I error inflation maximizes at .0975 with typical values from .0564 to .0883. To answer the second question, we review methods of adjusting the critical value to allow augmentation while maintaining p {$<$} .05, but we note that such methods must be applied a priori. For the common occurrence of post-hoc dataset augmentation, we develop a new statistic, paugmented, that represents the magnitude of the resulting Type I error inflation. We argue that the disclosure of post-hoc dataset augmentation via paugmented elevates such augmentation from a questionable research practice to an ethical research decision.},

  abstract = {Purpose~A statistical method called ``Magnitude-Based Inference'' (MBI) has gained a following in the sports science literature, despite concerns voiced by statisticians. Its proponents have claimed that MBI exhibits superior Type I and Type II error rates compared with standard null hypothesis testing for most cases. I have performed a re-analysis to evaluate this claim.
        Methods~Using simulation code provided by MBI's proponents, I estimated Type I and Type II error rates for clinical and non-clinical MBI for a range of effect sizes, sample sizes, and smallest important effects. I plotted these results in a way that makes transparent the empirical behavior of MBI. I also re-ran the simulations after correcting mistakes in the definitions of Type I and Type II error provided by MBI's proponents. Finally, I confirmed the findings mathematically; and I provide general equations for calculating MBI's error rates without the need for simulation.
        Results~Contrary to what MBI's proponents have claimed, MBI does not exhibit ``superior'' Type I and Type II error rates to standard null hypothesis testing. As expected, there is a tradeoff between Type I and Type II error. At precisely the small-to-moderate sample sizes that MBI's proponents deem ``optimal,'' MBI reduces the Type II error rate at the cost of greatly inflating the Type I error rate\textemdash to two to six times that of standard hypothesis testing.
        Conclusions~MBI exhibits worrisome empirical behavior. In contrast to standard null hypothesis testing, which has predictable Type I error rates, the Type I error rates for MBI vary widely depending on the sample size and choice of smallest important effect, and are often unacceptably high. MBI should not be used.

Analysis of the choices by correspondence analysis showed that each area (country) shows tendencies for unique color preference and that there are statistically significant differences in the frequency of selection of colors of certain hues and tones. However, a high preference for white was common to all areas, along with preferences for some other colors. The successive studies done by the author have shown a common strong preference for white in other Asian areas as well. The reasons given for the choices suggested that associative images based on environmental and cultural aspects may be important influences on color preference.},

  abstract = {Rhythmic synchronization phenomena in interpersonal communication are classified into two, based on its temporal aspect and behavioural form similarity aspect. We focus on the temporal aspect, movement synchrony, the gestalt-like perception of movement rhythmicity or coordination. With the aid of THEME, we aim to describe it based on statistical definition of objective behavioural data. Behavioural synchronization phenomena can also be conceptualised according to the number of actors involved in synchrony (selfsynchrony and interactional synchrony). In a waiting room situation, we unobtrusively videotaped initial interaction of unacquainted mixed-sex dyads, and investigated whether movement synchrony between a dyad related with the formation of interpersonal attraction. Participants' behaviour in the first and last minutes of initial 10-minute interaction was coded frame by frame. Movement synchrony measures calculated from it related with a participant's interest in the partner more strongly in the first minute than in the last minute. However, the relationships were mostly explained by the increase of movement frequency. A movement synchrony measure that remained to be a significant signal was the repetitiveness of behaviour time-sequences. A dyad with a male participant interested in the partner decreased the repetitiveness of movement synchrony in the first minute. On the other hand, a dyad with a female participant who reported frequent sexual approaches by male strangers showed increase in the repetitiveness of movement synchrony. It suggested that such behavioural characteristics of frequently approached women tend to be interpreted as a courtship-like signal by male strangers. Only among dyads with frequently picked up women, the increase of female self-synchrony patterns positively correlated with male interest in her, circumstantially supporting the explanation.},

At the study's end, inference focuses on the comparison of the selected treatment with the control using both stages' data. Traditional methods used to make inferences based on both stages' data can yield tests with higher than advertised levels of significance and confidence intervals with lower than advertised confidence. For normally distributed data, methods are provided to correct these deficiencies, providing confidence intervals with accurate levels of confidence.

In a series of 4 studies (N = 2, 463) and a mini meta-analysis, we explored the association between two canonical operationalisations of self-control: The Self-Control Scale and inhibitory executive functioning (the Stroop and Flanker paradigms). Overall, Bayesian correlational analyses suggest there is little to no relationship between self-reported self-control and inhibitory executive functioning. The Bayesian meta-analytical summary of all four studies favoured a null relationship between scores on self-reported self-control and inhibitory executive functioning, with self-control predicting no more than 0.5\% of the variance in inhibitory executive functions. These findings challenge the view that reported self-control assesses inhibitory control. Instead, it is probable that the real-world benefits associated with the Self-Control Scale arise from a process other than the overriding unwanted prepotent impulses.},

  abstract = {Publication bias arises whenever the probability that a study is published depends on the statistical significance of its results. This bias, often called the file-drawer effect since the unpublished results are imagined to be tucked away in researchers' file cabinets, is potentially a severe impediment to combining the statistical results of studies collected from the literature. With almost any reasonable quantitative model for publication bias, only a small number of studies lost in the file-drawer will produce a significant bias. This result contradicts the well known Fail Safe File Drawer (FSFD) method for setting limits on the potential harm of publication bias, widely used in social, medical and psychic research. This method incorrectly treats the file drawer as unbiased, and almost always misestimates the seriousness of publication bias. A large body of not only psychic research, but medical and social science studies, has mistakenly relied on this method to validate claimed discoveries. Statistical combination can be trusted only if it is known with certainty that all studies that have been carried out are included. Such certainty is virtually impossible to achieve in literature surveys.},

At best, Simpson's Paradox is used to argue that association is not causation. At worst, Simpson's Paradox is used to argue that induction is impossible in observational studies (that all arguments from association to causation are equally suspect) since any association could possibly be reversed by some yet unknown confounding factor. This paper reviews Corn- field's conditions - the necessary conditions for Simpson's Paradox - and argues that a simple-difference form of these conditions can be used to establish a minimum effect size for any potential confounder. Cornfield's minimum effect size is asserted to be a key element in statistical literacy. In order to teach this important concept, a graphical technique was developed to illustrate percentage-point difference comparisons. Some preliminary results of teaching these ideas in an introductory statistics course are presented. Copy at www.StatLit.org/pdf/1999SchieldASA.pdf},

  abstract = {Cohen (1962) pointed out the importance of statistical power for psychology as a science, but statistical power has not improved. At the same time, the number of studies has increased from a single study to multiple studies within a single article. It has been overlooked that multiple study articles are severely underpowered because power decreases as a function of the number of statistical tests that are being conducted (Maxwell, 2004). The discrepancy between the expected number of significant results and the actual number of significant results in multiple study articles undermine the credibility of the reported results and it is likely that questionable research practices contributed to the reporting of too many significant results (Sterling, 1959). The problem of low power in multiple study articles is illustrated using Bem's (2011) article on extrasensory perception and Gailliot et al.'s (2007) article on glucose and self-regulation. I conclude with several recommendations that can increase the credibility of scientific evidence in psychological journals. One major recommendation is to pay more attention to the power of studies to produce positive results without the help of questionable research practices and to request that authors justify sample sizes with a priori predictions of effect sizes. It is also important to publish replication studies with non-significant results, if these studies had high power to replicate a published finding.},

Although the term construct validity is widely used, few researchers follow Cronbach and Meehl's recommendation to quantify construct validity with the help of nomological networks. As a result, the construct validity of many popular measures in psychology is unknown. I call for rigorous tests of construct validity that follows Cronbach and Meehl's recommendations to improve psychology as a science. Without valid measures even replicable results are uninformative. I suggest that a proper program of validation research requires a multi-method approach and causal modeling of correlations with structural equation models. Construct validity should be quantified to enable cost benefit analyses and to replace existing measures with new measures with superior construct validity.},

  abstract = {In recent years, the replicability of original findings published in psychology journals has been questioned.  A key concern is that selection for significance inflates observed effect sizes and observed power. If selection bias is severe, replication studies are unlikely to reproduce a significant result. We introduce z-curve as a new method that can estimate the average true power for sets of studies that are selected for significance. We compare this method with p-curve, which has been used for the same purpose. Simulation studies show that both methods perform well when all studies have the same power, but p-curve overestimates power if power varies across studies. Based on these findings, we recommend z-curve to estimate power for sets of studies that are heterogeneous and selected for significance.  Application of z-curve to various datasets suggests that the average replicability of published results in psychology is approximately 50\%, but there is substantial heterogeneity and many psychological studies remain underpowered and are likely to produce false negative results.  To increase replicability and credibility of published results it is important to reduce selection bias and to increase statistical power.},

The authors present an integrative model of this phenomenon and propose that these nostalgic effects are not limited to products that relate to the arts and entertainment or are primarily aesthetic. As an illustrative example, the authors investigate the effects of early experience on consumer preferences for automobile styles. Consistent with expectations, they find that men do but women do not show evidence of nostalgic attachment to the styles experienced in their youth\textemdash that is, their preferences peaked for products that were popular when they were young. Also, as expected, individual differences in the psychographic variable of nostalgia proneness play a role in moderating these effects. These findings expand the understanding of the generality, the boundaries, and the managerial relevance of the age-related peak-preference phenomenon. \textcopyright{} 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

For example, some claim that harmony increases with hue similarity, whereas others claim that it decreases. We argue that such confusions are resolved by distinguishing among three types of judgments about color pairs: (1) preference for the pair as a whole, (2) harmony of the pair as a whole, and (3) preference for its figural color when viewed against its colored background. Empirical support for this distinction shows that pair preference and harmony both increase as hue similarity increases, but preference relies more strongly on component color preference and lightness contrast. Although pairs with highly contrastive hues are generally judged to be neither preferable nor harmonious, figural color preference ratings increase as hue contrast with the background increases. The present results thus refine and clarify some of the best-known and most contentious claims of color theorists.},

In experiment 1, we find that hue preferences for contextless squares generalize relatively well to hue preferences for imagined objects, with the substantial differences being in the saturation and lightness dimensions. In experiments 2 and 3, we find that object color preferences are relatively invariant when the objects are (a) imagined to be the color that is presented as a small square, (b) depicted as colored images of objects, and (c) viewed as actual physical objects. In experiment 4, we investigate the possibility that object color preferences are related to the degree to which colors help objects fulfill particular functions or outcomes.

  abstract = {Everyday human actions often occur in a social context. Past psychological research has found that the motor behavior of socially situated individuals tends to be coordinated. Our research performed over the last 20 years has sought to understand how the mutuality, accommodation and synchrony found in everyday interactional coordination can be understood using a dynamical theory of behavioral order, namely, coordination dynamics. Using laboratory interpersonal tasks, we have demonstrated that when two people are asked to rhythmically coordinate their limbs they show behavioral phenomena identical to those found in bimanual interlimb coordination, which has been mathematically modeled as a dynamical process. Research has demonstrated that these same dynamical organizing principles can coordinate the rhythmic movements of two people unintentionally and that the weaker, intermittent coordination that ensues is affected by both perceptual (e.g., attentional focus and information pick-up activity of the visual system) and dynamical constraints (e.g., intrapersonal rhythmic synergies and period basin of entrainment). Other research has investigated how traditional social and personality properties of a dyad (rapport, social competence) relate to dynamical properties of a dyad's coordinated movements and how the stability of coordinated movements mirrors the stability of mental connectedness experienced in social interactions.},

However, recent research has demonstrated that incidental feelings of disgust can influence moral judgments and make them more severe. This study involved two experiments demonstrating that the reverse effect can occur when the notion of physical purity is made salient, thus making moral judgments less severe. After having the cognitive concept of cleanliness activated (Experiment 1) or after physically cleansing themselves after experiencing disgust (Experiment 2), participants found certain moral actions to be less wrong than did participants who had not been exposed to a cleanliness manipulation. The findings support the idea that moral judgment can be driven by intuitive processes, rather than deliberate reasoning. One of those intuitions appears to be physical purity, because it has a strong connection to moral purity.},

In contrast, there is almost no literature that discusses the design of experiments when Bayes factors (BFs) are used as a measure of evidence. Here we explore Bayes Factor Design Analysis (BFDA) as a useful tool to design studies for maximum efficiency and informativeness. We elaborate on three possible BF designs, (a) a fixed-n design, (b) an open-ended Sequential Bayes Factor (SBF) design, where researchers can test after each participant and can stop data collection whenever there is strong evidence for either îˆ´1H1\textbackslash mathcal \{H\}\_\{1\} or îˆ´0H0\textbackslash mathcal \{H\}\_\{0\}, and (c) a modified SBF design that defines a maximal sample size where data collection is stopped regardless of the current state of evidence. We demonstrate how the properties of each design (i.e., expected strength of evidence, expected sample size, expected probability of misleading evidence, expected probability of weak evidence) can be evaluated using Monte Carlo simulations and equip researchers with the necessary information to compute their own Bayesian design analyses.},

  abstract = {Unplanned optional stopping rules have been criticized for inflating Type I error rates under the null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) paradigm. Despite these criticisms, this research practice is not uncommon, probably because it appeals to researcher's intuition to collect more data to push an indecisive result into a decisive region. In this contribution, we investigate the properties of a procedure for Bayesian hypothesis testing that allows optional stopping with unlimited multiple testing, even after each participant. In this procedure, which we call Sequential Bayes Factors (SBFs), Bayes factors are computed until an a priori defined level of evidence is reached. This allows flexible sampling plans and is not dependent upon correct effect size guesses in an a priori power analysis. We investigated the long-term rate of misleading evidence, the average expected sample sizes, and the biasedness of effect size estimates when an SBF design is applied to a test of mean differences between 2 groups. Compared with optimal NHST, the SBF design typically needs 50\% to 70\% smaller samples to reach a conclusion about the presence of an effect, while having the same or lower long-term rate of wrong inference.

  abstract = {The priming of concepts has been shown to influence peoples' subsequent actions, often unconsciously. We propose 3 mechanisms (psychological, cultural, and biological) as a unified explanation of such effects. (a) Primed concepts influence holistic representations of situations by parallel constraint satisfaction. (b) The constraints among representations stem from culturally shared affective meanings of concepts acquired in socialization. (c) Patterns of activity in neural populations act as semantic pointers linking symbolic concepts to underlying emotional and sensorimotor representations and thereby causing action. We present 2 computational models of behavioral priming that implement the proposed mechanisms. One is a localist neural network that connects primes with behaviors through central nodes simulating affective meanings. In a series of simulations, where the input is based on empirical data, we show that this model can explain a wide variety of experimental findings related to automatic social behavior. The second, neurocomputational model simulates spiking patterns in populations of biologically realistic neurons. We use this model to demonstrate how the proposed mechanisms can be implemented in the brain. Finally, we discuss how our models integrate previous theoretical accounts of priming phenomena. We also examine the interactions of psychological, cultural, and biological mechanisms in the control of automatic social behavior.},

  abstract = {Humans are surrounded by spatial asymmetries. Surprisingly, spatial asymmetries are not confined to our external environment. They penetrate our mental representations and have subtle but pervasive influences across several cognitive domains. I review evidence for the existence of a spatially asymmetric representation that takes the form of a horizontal directional schema. This schema underlies how we conceptualize actions and events. People in cultures that read and write from left to right conceptualize actions as proceeding from left to right; and they conceptualize agents of actions as being located on the left and recipients of actions as being located on the right. This left to right schema generalizes to memory and aesthetic evaluations. The evidence to date suggests that reading and writing habits influence the specific direction harbored within these schemas. I discuss possible neural instantiations of schemas and further speculate on why such schemas exist. Schemas serve as an intermediate level of abstraction. On the one hand they retain something of the analog structure of perceptual systems, and on the other they contain something of the flexibility of symbolic systems. As such, they are poised between sources of information about the world and our abilities to process and manipulate this information.},

  abstract = {Do interlimb rhythmic coordinations between individuals exhibit the same relations among the same observable quantities as interlimb rhythmic coordination within an individual? The 1:1 frequency locking between the limbs of two people was investigated using a paradigm in which each person oscillated a hand-held pendulum, achieving and maintaining the mutual entrainment through vision. The intended coordination was antiphase, \textasciitilde b= rr, and the difference between the uncoupled eigenfrequencies, Am, was manipulated through differences in the lengths of the two pendulums. The mean phase relation and its variance for visually coupled coordinations differing in Am were predicted by an order parameter equation developed by Haken et al. (1985) and Schrner et al. (1986) for the relative phase of correlated movements of limb segments. Specifically, the experiment revealed that: (1) the deviation of \textasciitilde bfrom n increased with increasing deviation of Ao9from 0; and (2) fluctuations in q\textasciitilde increased with increasing deviation of Am from 0. With deviations of Ao\textasciitilde from 0, new peaks were added at higher harmonics in q\textasciitilde 'spower spectrum. These results were in agreement with previous research on the stable states of interlimb coordination within a person, mediated by mechanoreceptive rather than photoreceptive mechanisms. Additionally, they were in agreement with previous research on phase transitions in interlimb coordination which have been shown to conform to the same order parameter dynamics whether the coupling be mechanoreceptively or photoreceptively based. It was suggested that phase entrainment in biological movement systems may abide by dynamical principles that are indifferent to the details of the coupling.},

Although the issues have been generally well-covered in the statistical literature, they seem to be poorly understood in the medical literature and even the statistical literature occasionally shows some confusion. To increase understanding and communication, some simple graphical approaches to illustrating issues are proposed. It is also suggested that reducing variation in medical practice might make as big a contribution to improving health outcome as personalising its delivery according to the patient. It is concluded that the common belief that there is a strong personal element in response to treatment is not based on sound statistical evidence. \textcopyright{} 2015 The Authors.

Under the normal allocation the display large/ LARGE was generally classified as `Yes' faster than small/SMALL or the incongruent displays. Under the reversed allocation congruent displays were classified faster than incongruent displays, but no difference appeared between large/LARGE and small/ SMALL. Also, response times were slower under the reversed allocation than under the normal allocation. In experiment 2, 12 subjects classified the displays white/LARGE, blackJSMALL, white/SMALL and black/LARGE, as `Yes' or `No' under allocations which mimicked experiment 1. In this set, where a congruence relation was not involved, reversal of the display-report allocation did not affect response times. However, times for individual displays were indicative of bias towards whichever display included a LARGE shape and was also assigned to the response `Yes'. Some implications of these results for a general theory of congruence judgements are suggested.},

In many disciplines there is near-exclusive use of statistical modeling for causal explanation and the assumption that models with high explanatory power are inherently of high predictive power. Conflation between explanation and prediction is common, yet the distinction must be understood for progressing scientific knowledge. While this distinction has been recognized in the philosophy of science, the statistical literature lacks a thorough discussion of the many differences that arise in the process of modeling for an explanatory versus a predictive goal. The purpose of this article is to clarify the distinction between explanatory and predictive modeling, to discuss its sources, and to reveal the practical implications of the distinction to each step in the modeling process.},

The expectation is that most statistically significant findings can be replicated in new data and in new laboratories, but in practice many findings have replicated less often than expected, leading to claims of a replication crisis. We review recent methodological literature on questionable research practices, meta-analysis, and power analysis to explain the apparently high rates of failure to replicate. Psychologists can improve research practices to advance knowledge in ways that improve replicability. We recommend that researchers adopt open science conventions of preregi-stration and full disclosure and that replication efforts be based on multiple studies rather than on a single replication attempt. We call for more sophisticated power analyses, careful consideration of the various influences on effect sizes, and more complete disclosure of nonsignificant as well as statistically significant findings.},

Yet, few papers identify their target populations, and even fewer justify how or why the tested samples are representative of broader populations. A cumulative science depends on accurately characterizing the generality of findings, but current publishing standards do not require authors to constrain their inferences, leaving readers to assume the broadest possible generalizations. We propose that the discussion section of all primary research articles specify Constraints on Generality (i.e., a ``COG'' statement) that identify and justify target populations for the reported findings. Explicitly defining the target populations will help other researchers to sample from the same populations when conducting a direct replication, and it could encourage follow-up studies that test the boundary conditions of the original finding. Universal adoption of COG statements would change publishing incentives to favor a more cumulative science.},

Its benefits include the following: (a) differentiating ``unsuccessful'' replication attempts (i.e., studies yielding p {$>$} .05) that are too noisy from those that actively indicate the effect is undetectably different from zero, (b) ``protecting'' true findings from underpowered replications, and (c) arriving at intuitively compelling inferences in general and for the revisited replications in particular.},

  abstract = {Poor research design and data analysis encourage false-positive findings. Such poor methods persist despite perennial calls for improvement, suggesting that they result from something more than just misunderstanding. The persistence of poor methods results partly from incentives that favour them, leading to the natural selection of bad science. This dynamic requires no conscious strategizing\textemdash no deliberate cheating nor loafing\textemdash by scientists, only that publication is a principal factor for career advancement. Some normative methods of analysis have almost certainly been selected to further publication instead of discovery. In order to improve the culture of science, a shift must be made away from correcting misunderstandings and towards rewarding understanding. We support this argument with empirical evidence and computational modelling. We first present a 60-year meta-analysis of statistical power in the behavioural sciences and show that power has not improved despite repeated demonstrations of the necessity of increasing power. To demonstrate the logical consequences of structural incentives, we then present a dynamic model of scientific communities in which competing laboratories investigate novel or previously published hypotheses using culturally transmitted research methods. As in the real world, successful labs produce more `progeny,' such that their methods are more often copied and their students are more likely to start labs of their own. Selection for high output leads to poorer methods and increasingly high false discovery rates. We additionally show that replication slows but does not stop the process of methodological deterioration. Improving the quality of research requires change at the institutional level.},

  abstract = {We propose a new integration of social psychology and situated cognition, which we term socially situated cognition (SSC). This new approach rests directly on recent developments in psychology and cognitive science captured by the label situated cognition, but also has roots going back to William James and Frederick Bartlett. The approach involves a shift in the guiding metaphor regarding cognition and action, from computation to biology, and highlights four core assumptions that are common to social psychology and the situated cognition perspective. (a) Cognition is for the adaptive regulation of action, and mental representations are action-oriented. (b) Cognition is embodied, drawing on our sensori-motor abilities and environments as well as our brains. (c) Cognition and action are the emergent outcome of dynamic processes of interaction between an agent and an environment. (d) Cognition is distributed across brains and the environment (e.g., through the use of tools) and across social agents (e.g., when information is discussed and evaluated in groups). With regard to each of these themes, we review and integrate relevant social psychological research, and also suggest ways in which the theme can be carried further by rethinking current assumptions. Our overall goals are both to make social psychology part of the interdisciplinary integration emerging around the concept of situated cognition, and to advance these four themes as high-level conceptual principles that can organize seemingly disparate areas of research and theory within social psychology itself.},

Here we show that this criticism sidesteps our most relevant critique of their study. Yet, we heed their advice, reattempt the replication using their own white suicide data, and still fail to produce a significant effect of country music on white suicide. Although the two are related bivariately, controlling for divorce, poverty, southern region, and gun availability results in a near-zero multivariate effect.},

A 2 \texttimes{} 2 \texttimes{} 3 mixed design was used in the study, with product aesthetics (high/low) and usability (high/low) being manipulated as between-subjects variables and exposure time as a repeated-measures variable (three levels). A sample of 60 mobile phone users was tested during a multiple-session usability test. A range of outcome variables was measured, including performance, perceived usability, perceived aesthetics and emotion. A major finding was that the positive effect of an aesthetically appealing product on perceived usability, reported in many previous studies, began to wane with increasing exposure time. The data provided similar evidence for emotion, which also showed changes as a function of exposure time. The study has methodological implications for the future design of usability tests, notably suggesting the need for longitudinal approaches in usability research. Practitioner Summary: This study indicates that product aesthetics influences perceived usability considerably in one-off usability tests but this influence wanes over time. When completing a usability test it is therefore advisable to adopt a longitudinal multiple-session approach to reduce the possibly undesirable influence of aesthetics on usability ratings.},

Discussions spanned good practices for NP characterization and quality control; use and interpretation of models (computational through in vivo) with strong clinical predictive validity; controls for experimental artefacts, especially for in vitro interrogation of bioactivity and mechanisms of action; rigorous assessment and interpretation of prior research; transparency in all reporting; and prioritization of research questions. Natural product clinical trials prioritized based on rigorous, convergent supporting data and current public health needs are most likely to be informative and ultimately affect public health. Thoughtful, coordinated implementation of these practices should enhance the knowledge gained from future NP research.},

  abstract = {Crisis of replicability is one term that psychological scientists use for the current introspective phase we are in\textemdash I argue instead that we are going through a revolution analogous to a political revolution. Revolution 2.0 is an uprising focused on how we should be doing science now (i.e., in a 2.0 world). The precipitating events of the revolution have already been well-documented: failures to replicate, questionable research practices, fraud, etc. And the fact that none of these events is new to our field has also been well-documented. I suggest four interconnected reasons as to why this time is different: changing technology, changing demographics of researchers, limited resources, and misaligned incentives. I then describe two reasons why the revolution is more likely to catch on this time: technology (as part of the solution) and the fact that these concerns cut across social and life sciences\textemdash that is, we are not alone. Neither side in the revolution has behaved well, and each has characterized the other in extreme terms (although, of course, each has had a few extreme actors). Some suggested reforms are already taking hold (e.g., journals asking for more transparency in methods and analysis decisions; journals publishing replications) but the feared tyrannical requirements have, of course, not taken root (e.g., few journals require open data; there is no ban on exploratory analyses). Still, we have not yet made needed advances in the ways in which we accumulate, connect, and extract conclusions from our aggregated research. However, we are now ready to move forward by adopting incremental changes and by acknowledging the multiplicity of goals within psychological science.},

In two experiments, eye movements were recorded while observers imagined or recalled objects that were not present in the visual display. In both cases, observers spontaneously looked at particular blank regions of space in a systematic fashion, to manipulate and organize spatial relationships between mental and/or retinal images. These results contribute to evidence that interpreting a linguistic description of a visual scene requires a spatial (mental model) representation, and they support claims regarding the allocation of position markers in visual space for the manipulation of visual attention. More broadly, our results point to a concrete embodiment of cognition, in that a construction of a mental image is almost ``acted out'' by the eye movements, and a mental search of internal memory is accompanied by an ocolumotor search of external space.},

The approach uses the method of backward induction to obtain group sequential designs that are optimal with respect to some specified gain function. A gain function is proposed focussing on the financial costs of, and potential profits from, the drug development programme. On the basis of this gain function, the optimal procedure is also compared with an alternative Bayesian procedure proposed by Thall and Simon. The latter method, which tightly controls type I error rate, is shown to lead to an expected gain considerably smaller than that from the optimal test. Gain functions with respect to which Thall and Simon's boundary is optimal are sought and it is shown that these can only be of the form considered, that is, with constant cost for phase III study and cost of the phase II study proportional to the sample size, if potential profit increases over time.},

According to perceptual symbol theories, the complete representation of an object, called a simulation, should reflect physical characteristics of the object. Amodal theories, in contrast, do not make this prediction. We tested the hypothesis, derived from perceptual symbol theories, that people mentally represent the orientation of an object implied by a verbal description. Orientation (vertical-horizontal) was manipulated by having participants read a sentence that implicitly suggested a particular orientation for an object. Then recognition latencies to pictures of the object in each of the two orientations were measured. Pictures matching the orientation of the object implied by the sentence were responded to faster than pictures that did not match the orientation. This finding is interpreted as offering support for theories positing perceptual symbol systems.},

Data processing often involves choices among several reasonable options for excluding, transforming, and coding data. We suggest that instead of performing only one analysis, researchers could perform a multiverse analysis, which involves performing all analyses across the whole set of alternatively processed data sets corresponding to a large set of reasonable scenarios. Using an example focusing on the effect of fertility on religiosity and political attitudes, we show that analyzing a single data set can be misleading and propose a multiverse analysis as an alternative practice. A multiverse analysis offers an idea of how much the conclusions change because of arbitrary choices in data construction and gives pointers as to which choices are most consequential in the fragility of the result.},

Specifically, their interpretation of these cases depends on problematic premises that it is epistemically better to wait for a slower-but-more-reliable method than to accept the result of a quicker-but-less-reliable one and that a more detailed model is epistemically preferable to a simpler one.},

  abstract = {Scholars in philosophy, law, economics and other fields have widely debated how science, environmental precaution, and economic interests should be balanced in urgent contemporary problems, such as climate change. One controversial focus of these discussions is the precautionary principle, according to which scientific uncertainty should not be a reason for delay in the face of serious threats to the environment or health. While the precautionary principle has been very influential, no generally accepted definition of it exists and critics charge that it is incoherent or hopelessly vague. This book presents and defends an interpretation of the precautionary principle from the perspective of philosophy of science, looking particularly at how it connects to decisions, scientific procedures, and evidence. Through careful analysis of numerous case studies, it shows how this interpretation leads to important insights on scientific uncertainty, intergenerational justice, and the relationship between values and policy-relevant science.},

The goal of the WSC is to assess whether nonexperimental and experimental designs yield the same results in field settings. A common analytic challenge with WSCs, however, is the choice of appropriate criteria for determining whether nonexperimental and experimental results replicate. This article examines different distance-based correspondence measures for assessing correspondence in experimental and nonexperimental estimates. Distance-based measures investigate whether the difference in estimates is small enough to claim equivalence of methods. We use a simulation study to examine the statistical properties of common correspondence measures and recommend a new and straightforward approach that combines traditional significance testing and equivalence testing in the same framework. The article concludes with practical advice on assessing and interpreting results in WSC contexts.},

Replication has long been a cornerstone for establishing trustworthy scientific results, but there remains considerable disagreement about what constitutes a replication, how results from these studies should be interpreted, and whether direct replication of results is even possible. This article addresses these concerns by presenting the methodological foundations for a replication science. It provides an introduction to the causal replication framework, which defines ``replication'' as a research design that tests whether two (or more) studies produce the same causal effect within the limits of sampling error. The framework formalizes the conditions under which replication success can be expected, and allows for the causal interpretation of replication failures. Through two applied examples, the article demonstrates how the causal replication framework may be utilized to plan prospective replication designs, as well as to interpret results from existing replication efforts.},

  abstract = {With the increase in genomewide experiments and the sequencing of multiple genomes, the analysis of large data sets has become commonplace in biology. It is often the case that thousands of features in a genomewide data set are tested against some null hypothesis, where a number of features are expected to be significant. Here we propose an approach to measuring statistical significance in these genomewide studies based on the concept of the false discovery rate. This approach offers a sensible balance between the number of true and false positives that is automatically calibrated and easily interpreted. In doing so, a measure of statistical significance called the q value is associated with each tested feature. The q value is similar to the well known p value, except it is a measure of significance in terms of the false discovery rate rather than the false positive rate. Our approach avoids a flood of false positive results, while offering a more liberal criterion than what has been used in genome scans for linkage.},

What they rarely learn, however, is how to actually theorize. The Art of Social Theory is a practical guide to doing just that.In this one-of-a-kind user's manual for social theorists, Richard Swedberg explains how theorizing occurs in what he calls the context of discovery, a process in which the researcher gathers preliminary data and thinks creatively about it using tools such as metaphor, analogy, and typology. He guides readers through each step of the theorist's art, from observation and naming to concept formation and explanation. To theorize well, you also need a sound knowledge of existing social theory. Swedberg introduces readers to the most important theories and concepts, and discusses how to go about mastering them. If you can think, you can also learn to theorize. This book shows you how.Concise and accessible, The Art of Social Theory features helpful examples throughout, and also provides practical exercises that enable readers to learn through doing"--},

It helps to develop the desired data for knowledge developing tools in science and shows how far the evidential statistical paradigm goes toward meeting these objectives. It also relates evidential statistics to the competing paradigms of Bayesian statistics and error statistics. Individual scientists have personal beliefs regarding the theories and even the observations of science. The statistical evidence measures the differences of models from truth in a single dimension and consequently may flatten some of the richness of a linguistic theory. The issue of quantifying evidence in the data has always vexed statisticians. Under the evidential paradigm, the composite hypothesis problem can be recast as a model selection problem among models with different numbers of free parameters. The elevation of evidentialism to a practical statistical approach is due to Royall's introduction of the concepts of weak and strong evidence and of misleading evidence.},

Surprise ratings and probability estimates differ, however, in some important ways. Surprises are generally created by low-probability outcomes, yet, as shown by several experiments, not all low-probability outcomes are equally surprising. To account for surprise, we propose a contrast hypothesis according to which the level of surprise associated with an outcome is mainly determined by the extent to which it contrasts with the default, expected alternative. Three ways by which contrasts can be established are explored: contrasts due to relative probabilities, where the obtained outcome is less likely than a default alternative; contrasts formed by novelty and change, where a contrast exists between the obtained outcome and the individual's previous experience; and contrasts due to the perceptual or conceptual distance between the expected and the obtained. In all these cases, greater contrast was accompanied by higher ratings of surprise. q 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

One of the proposed alternatives to NHST is using Bayes factors instead of p values. Here we denote the method of using Bayes factors to test point null models as "null hypothesis Bayesian testing" (NHBT). In this article we offer a wide overview of potential issues (limitations or sources of misinterpretation) with NHBT which is currently missing in the literature. We illustrate many of the shortcomings of NHBT by means of reproducible examples. The article concludes with a discussion of NHBT in particular and testing in general. In particular, we argue that posterior model probabilities should be given more emphasis than Bayes factors, because only the former provide direct answers to the most common research questions under consideration.

Starting with some basic assumptions about natural kinds, he derived an exponential decay function as the form of the universal generalization gradient, which accords strikingly well with a wide range of empirical data. However, his original formulation applied only to the ideal case of generalization from a single encountered stimulus to a single novel stimulus, and for stimuli that can be represented as points in a continuous metric psychological space. Here we recast Shepard's theory in a more general Bayesian framework and show how this naturally extends his approach to the more realistic situation of generalizing from multiple consequential stimuli with arbitrary representational structure. Our framework also subsumes a version of Tversky's set-theoretic model of similarity, which is conventionally thought of as the primary alternative to Shepard's continuous metric space model of similarity and generalization. This unification allows us not only to draw deep parallels between the set-theoretic and spatial approaches, but also to significantly advance the explanatory power of set-theoretic models.},

  abstract = {Studies accumulate over time and meta-analyses are mainly retrospective. These two characteristics introduce dependencies between the analysis time, at which a series of studies is up for meta-analysis, and results within the series. Dependencies introduce bias --- Accumulation Bias --- and invalidate the sampling distribution assumed for p-value tests, thus inflating type-I errors. But dependencies are also inevitable, since for science to accumulate efficiently, new research needs to be informed by past results. Here, we investigate various ways in which time influences error control in meta-analysis testing. We introduce an Accumulation Bias Framework that allows us to model a wide variety of practically occurring dependencies, including study series accumulation, meta-analysis timing, and approaches to multiple testing in living systematic reviews. The strength of this framework is that it shows how all dependencies affect p-value-based tests in a similar manner. This leads to two main conclusions. First, Accumulation Bias is inevitable, and even if it can be approximated and accounted for, no valid p-value tests can be constructed. Second, tests based on likelihood ratios withstand Accumulation Bias: they provide bounds on error probabilities that remain valid despite the bias. We leave the reader with a choice between two proposals to consider time in error control: either treat individual (primary) studies and meta-analyses as two separate worlds --- each with their own timing --- or integrate individual studies in the meta-analysis world. Taking up likelihood ratios in either approach allows for valid tests that relate well to the accumulating nature of scientific knowledge. Likelihood ratios can be interpreted as betting profits, earned in previous studies and invested in new ones, while the meta-analyst is allowed to cash out at any time and advise against future studies.},

  abstract = {This article proceeds from the premise that a completely value-neutral political psychology is impossible. Testing hypotheses about the efficacy of deterrence or the pervasiveness of racism or the quality of decision making inevitably requires value-charged trade-offs between Type I errors (rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true) and Type II errors (failing to reject the null hypothesis when it is false). The article goes on, however, to argue that our collective credibility as a science depends on self-critical efforts to monitor and minimize the influence of scientifically irrelevant values on inquiry. I identify two examples of research programs-White's work on deterrence and the Sears and Kinder work on symbolic racism-in which the moral-political values of the investigators appear to have profoundly shaped standards of evidence and proof in testing competing hypotheses. I also identify logical and empirical strategies that investigators can use to check the influence of extraneous values. These strategies include rigorous skepticism toward counterfactuals that underlie causal claims in historical analyses, embedding of experimental manipulations in representative sample surveys to isolate determinants of public opinion, developing methods to translate case studies into standardized data languages so that we can more readily identify potential sources of bias, and continual open-mindedness to the possibility that patterns of thinking that scholarly observers laud as cognitively or morally superior in one set of political settings may look quite maladaptive or immoral in other political settings. The article closes with a transparently valueladen appeal to preserve the autonomy of political psychology as a science by distinguishing sharply between when we speak for a scientific discipline and when we speak as concerned citizens.},

Information asymmetries and conflicts of interest incentivize scientists to deceive journals about the quality of their research. How can honesty be ensured, despite incentives to lie?

It has recently been demonstrated that joint-action effects in a Simon task provide a good index for corepresentation. In the present study, we investigated whether corepresentation is restricted to biological agents or also occurs for nonbiological events. Participants performed a Simon task either with an image of a human hand or with a wooden analogue. The Simon-like effect emerged only when participants coacted with a biological agent. The lack of the joint-action effect when participants interacted with a wooden hand indicates that the human corepresentation system is biologically tuned.},

A CAMA is a combination of a meta-analysis and an open repository. Like a meta-analysis, it is centered around a psychologically relevant topic and includes methodological details and standardized effect sizes. As in a repository, data do not remain undisclosed and static after publication but can be used and extended by the research community, as anyone can download all information and can add new data via simple forms. Based on our experiences with building three CAMAs, we illustrate the concept and explain how CAMAs can facilitate improving our research practices via the integration of past research, the accumulation of knowledge, and the documentation of file-drawer studies.},

The affiliations for coauthors Kuangjie Zhang and Steven Sweldens were incorrect. All versions of this article have been corrected.] A rich tradition in self-control research has documented the negative consequences of exerting self-control in 1 task for self-control performance in subsequent tasks. However, there is a dearth of research examining what happens when people exert self-control in multiple domains simultaneously. The current research aims to fill this gap. We integrate predictions from the most prominent models of self-control with recent neuropsychological insights in the human inhibition system to generate the novel hypothesis that exerting effortful self-control in 1 task can simultaneously improve self-control in completely unrelated domains. An internal meta-analysis on all 18 studies we conducted shows that exerting self-control in 1 domain (i.e., controlling attention, food consumption, emotions, or thoughts) simultaneously improves self-control in a range of other domains, as demonstrated by, for example, reduced unhealthy food consumption, better Stroop task performance, and less impulsive decision making. A subset of 9 studies demonstrates the crucial nature of task timing\textemdash when the same tasks are executed sequentially, our results suggest the emergence of an ego depletion effect. We provide conservative estimates of the self-control facilitation (d = |0.22|) as well as the ego depletion effect size (d = |0.17|) free of data selection and publication biases. These results (a) shed new light on self-control theories, (b) confirm recent claims that previous estimates of the ego depletion effect size were inflated due to publication bias, and (c) provide a blueprint for how to handle the power issues and associated file drawer problems commonly encountered in multistudy research projects.},

Although this approach has the obvious advantage of obtaining narrower confidence intervals, we show that it could inadvertently inflate false-positive rates if researchers are motivated to use internal meta-analysis in order to obtain a significant overall effect. Specifically, if one decides whether to stop or continue a further replication experiment depending on the significance of the results in an internal meta-analysis, false-positive rates would increase beyond the nominal level. We conducted a set of Monte Carlo simulations to demonstrate our argument, and provided a literature review to gauge awareness and prevalence of this issue. Furthermore, we made several recommendations when using internal meta-analysis to make a judgment on statistical significance.},

  abstract = {Although evidence has suggested that synchronized movement can foster cooperation, the ability of synchrony to increase costly altruism and to operate as a function of emotional mechanisms remains unexplored. We predicted that synchrony, due to an ability to elicit low-level appraisals of similarity, would enhance a basic compassionate response toward victims of moral transgressions and thereby increase subsequent costly helping behavior on their behalf. Using a manipulation of rhythmic synchrony, we show that synchronous others are not only perceived to be more similar to oneself but also evoke more compassion and altruistic behavior than asynchronous others experiencing the same plight. These findings both support the view that a primary function of synchrony is to mark others as similar to the self and provide the first empirical demonstration that synchrony-induced affiliation modulates emotional responding and altruism.},

  abstract = {Background
The analysis of small data sets in longitudinal studies can lead to power issues and often suffers from biased parameter values. These issues can be solved by using Bayesian estimation in conjunction with informative prior distributions. By means of a simulation study and an empirical example concerning posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) following mechanical ventilation in burn survivors, we demonstrate the advantages and potential pitfalls of using Bayesian estimation.

Methods
First, we show how to specify prior distributions and by means of a sensitivity analysis we demonstrate how to check the exact influence of the prior (mis-) specification. Thereafter, we show by means of a simulation the situations in which the Bayesian approach outperforms the default, maximum likelihood and approach. Finally, we re-analyze empirical data on burn survivors which provided preliminary evidence of an aversive influence of a period of mechanical ventilation on the course of PTSS following burns.

Results
Not suprisingly, maximum likelihood estimation showed insufficient coverage as well as power with very small samples. Only when Bayesian analysis, in conjunction with informative priors, was used power increased to acceptable levels. As expected, we showed that the smaller the sample size the more the results rely on the prior specification.

Conclusion
We show that two issues often encountered during analysis of small samples, power and biased parameters, can be solved by including prior information into Bayesian analysis. We argue that the use of informative priors should always be reported together with a sensitivity analysis.},

  abstract = {Although the statistical tools most often used by researchers in the field of psychology over the last 25 years are based on frequentist statistics, it is often claimed that the alternative Bayesian approach to statistics is gaining in popularity. In the current article, we investigated this claim by performing the very first systematic review of Bayesian psychological articles published between 1990 and 2015 (n Ï­ 1,579). We aim to provide a thorough presentation of the role Bayesian statistics plays in psychology. This historical assessment allows us to identify trends and see how Bayesian methods have been integrated into psychological research in the context of different statistical frameworks (e.g., hypothesis testing, cognitive models, IRT, SEM, etc.). We also describe take-home messages and provide ``big-picture'' recommendations to the field as Bayesian statistics becomes more popular. Our review indicated that Bayesian statistics is used in a variety of contexts across subfields of psychology and related disciplines. There are many different reasons why one might choose to use Bayes (e.g., the use of priors, estimating otherwise intractable models, modeling uncertainty, etc.). We found in this review that the use of Bayes has increased and broadened in the sense that this methodology can be used in a flexible manner to tackle many different forms of questions. We hope this presentation opens the door for a larger discussion regarding the current state of Bayesian statistics, as well as future trends.},

Yet, distance is rarely studied as a moderator of moral judgment processes. We focus on the influence of disgust on moral judgments, as evidence here has remained inconclusive. Based on feelings as information theory and the notion that disgust evolved as a pathogen avoidance mechanism, we argue that disgust influences moral judgment of psychologically distant (vs. near) norm violations. Studies 1 and 3 show that trait disgust sensitivity (but not trait anger and fear) more strongly predicts moral judgment of distant than near violations. Studies 2 and 4 show that incidental disgust affects moral judgment of distant (vs. near) violations and that the moderating role of distance is mediated by involvement of others (vs. the self) in the evaluator's conceptualization of the violation.},

  abstract = {Surveys indicate that researchers generally have a positive attitude towards open peer review when this consists of making reviews available alongside published articles. Researchers are more negative about revealing the identity of reviewers. They worry reviewers will be less likely to express criticism if their identity is known to authors. Experiments suggest that reviewers are somewhat less likely to recommend rejection when they are told their identity will be communicated to authors, than when they will remain anonymous. One recent study revealed reviewers in five journals who voluntarily signed their reviews gave more positive recommendations than those who did not sign their reviews. We replicate and extend this finding by analyzing 12010 open reviews in PeerJ and 4188 reviews in the Royal Society Open Science where authors can voluntarily sign their reviews. These results based on behavioral data from real peer reviews across a wide range of scientific disciplines demonstrate convincingly that reviewers' decision to sign is related to their recommendation. The proportion of signed reviews was higher for more positive recommendations, than for more negative recommendations. We also share all 23649 text mined reviews as raw data underlying our results that can be re-used by researchers interested in peer review.},

  abstract = {A commonly voiced concern with the Bayes factor is that, unlike many other Bayesian and non-Bayesian quantitative measures of model evaluation, it is highly sensitive to the parameter prior. This paper argues that, when dealing with psychological models that are quantitatively instantiated theories, being sensitive to the prior is an attractive feature of a model evaluation measure. This assertion follows from the observation that in psychological models parameters are not completely unknown, but correspond to psychological variables about which theory often exists. This theory can be formally captured in the prior range and prior distribution of the parameters, indicating which parameter values are allowed, likely, unlikely and forbidden. Because the prior is a vehicle for expressing psychological theory, it should, like the model equation, be considered as an integral part of the model. It is argued that the combined practice of building models using informative priors, and evaluating models using prior sensitive measures advances knowledge.},

I propose an extension to the Registered Modeling Report format, the Really Risky Registered Modeling Report, in which reviewers are required to evaluate whether a bad fit between the model predictions and the empirical data is plausible. The two crucial additions are that authors include prior predictions in the protocol and that reviewers set a data prior in Stage 1. Only protocols containing predictions that are not almost guaranteed to be confirmed when brought in contact with empirical data are eligible for in principle acceptance. Adopting the Really Risky Registered Modeling Report will lead to strong model tests and solid evidence.},

Opportunistic use of `researcher degrees of freedom' aimed at obtaining statistical significance increases the likelihood of obtaining false positive results and overestimated effect sizes, and lowers the replicability of published results. Preregistration is a mechanism for reducing such degrees of freedom by specifying designs and analysis plans before observing the research outcomes.  The effectiveness of preregistration may depend, in part, on whether the process facilitates sufficiently specific articulation of such plans.  We compared two formats of preregistration available on the OSF: Standard Pre-Data Collection Registration and Prereg Challenge registration.  The Prereg Challenge format provides detailed instructions, a guided workflow, and an independent review to confirm completeness; the ``Standard'' format has minimal direct guidance to give researchers flexibility for what to pre-specify. Results of comparing random samples of 53 preregistrations from each format indicate that neither format restricted all researcher degrees of freedom and the Prereg Challenge format performed better on restricting degrees of freedom than the ``Standard'' format.  Preregistering research is an acquired skill, and registration formats that provide effective guidance will improve the quality of research.},

The objective of this cost-benefit analysis was to determine the utility of four functional screening procedures used to identify drivers at risk for motor-vehicle collisions, as well as an intervention designed to maintain or improve functional abilities. Additionally, this study sought to determine the expected cost per driver if an intervention was designed to target only those drivers who failed the functional ability-based driving screen, versus the expected cost per driver if the intervention was distributed en masse to all drivers 75 years and older. Improving functional abilities in older adults has potential far-reaching health and financial impacts which are broader than their impact of maintaining mobility. Methods. A decision tree was constructed to evaluate the expected costs and benefits of (a) screening all drivers and intervening when indicated (several screening batteries of varying length were considered), (b) no screening, but intervening with all drivers of older age, or (c) neither screening nor intervening (i.e., re-licensing per usual). Test characteristics and risk probabilities were based on a cohort of drivers aged 75 and older from a previous study (Ball et al., 2006). Relevant sensitivity analyses were conducted. Results. Providing all drivers with the speed-of-processing intervention is the most cost-beneficial option (expected cost per driver = \$493.30), even if the cost of the intervention doubles. Sensitivity analysis indicated the effectiveness of the intervention could drop from 86\% to 25\% and the preventative approach of intervening with all drivers remains the most cost-beneficial strategy. The least cost-beneficial option is almost always re-licensing per usual (expected cost per driver = \$1,562.84). Conclusion. Screening drivers upon license renewal is not currently beneficial because the available technology cannot consistently identify drivers at risk for a collision. However, the speed-of-processing intervention has demonstrated efficacy in improving driving competence (Roenker et al., 2003) and is a non-invasive, moderate-cost intervention that has the potential to protect the safety and mobility, as well as the financial interests, of older drivers and the community at large.},

Research in this area has become prominent in a variety of domains both within and outside of psychology, forming a sizeable literature dedicated to investigating the causes and consequences of interpersonal coordination. We conducted a series of meta-analyses on studies that treated interpersonal coordination as an independent variable, in order to measure its effect on several intrapersonal (e.g., mood, need to belong) and interpersonal (e.g., prosocial behavior) outcomes, as well as several potential moderators (e.g., percentage of female participants) that may affect the strength of the effect. Overall, the results demonstrated that the positive effects of interpersonal coordination are robust, with a few exceptions specific to intrapersonal outcomes. These findings provide a much-needed quantitative summary of the literature on interpersonal coordination, and highlight areas that merit future research.},

  abstract = {Background
In many randomized and non-randomized comparative trials, researchers measure a continuous endpoint repeatedly in order to decrease intra-patient variability and thus increase statistical power. There has been little guidance in the literature as to selecting the optimal number of repeated measures.

Methods
The degree to which adding a further measure increases statistical power can be derived from simple formulae. This "marginal benefit" can be used to inform the optimal number of repeat assessments.

Results
Although repeating assessments can have dramatic effects on power, marginal benefit of an additional measure rapidly decreases as the number of measures rises. There is little value in increasing the number of either baseline or post-treatment assessments beyond four, or seven where baseline assessments are taken. An exception is when correlations between measures are low, for instance, episodic conditions such as headache.

Conclusions
The proposed method offers a rational basis for determining the number of repeat measures in repeat measures designs.},

  abstract = {In the field of psychology, the practice of p value null-hypothesis testing is as widespread as ever. Despite this popularity, or perhaps because of it, most psychologists are not aware of the statistical peculiarities of the p value procedure. In particular, p values are based on data that were never observed, and these hypothetical data are themselves influenced by subjective intentions. Moreover, p values do not quantify statistical evidence. This article reviews these p value problems and illustrates each problem with concrete examples. The three problems are familiar to statisticians but may be new to psychologists. A practical solution to these p value problems is to adopt a model selection perspective and use the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) for statistical inference (Raftery, 1995). The BIC provides an approximation to a Bayesian hypothesis test, does not require the specification of priors, and can be easily calculated from SPSS output.},

We reanalyze Bem's data with a default Bayesian t test and show that the evidence for psi is weak to nonexistent. We argue that in order to convince a skeptical audience of a controversial claim, one needs to conduct strictly confirmatory studies and analyze the results with statistical tests that are conservative rather than liberal. We conclude that Bem's p values do not indicate evidence in favor of precognition; instead, they indicate that experimental psychologists need to change the way they conduct their experiments and analyze their data.},

  abstract = {The foundations of a general theory of statistical decision functions, including the classical non-sequential case as well as the sequential case, was discussed by the author in a previous publication [3]. Several assumptions made in [3] appear, however, to be unnecessarily restrictive (see conditions 1-7, pp. 297 in [3]). These assumptions, moreover, are not always fulfilled for statistical problems in their conventional form. In this paper the main results of [3], as well as several new results, are obtained from a considerably weaker set of conditions which are fulfilled for most of the statistical problems treated in the literature. It seemed necessary to abandon most of the methods of proofs used in [3] (particularly those in section 4 of [3]) and to develop the theory from the beginning. To make the present paper self-contained, the basic definitions already given in [3] are briefly restated in section 2.1. In [3] it is postulated (see Condition 3, p. 207) that the space {$\Omega\Omega\backslash$}Omega of all admissible distribution functions FFF is compact. In problems where the distribution function FFF is known except for the values of a finite number of parameters, i.e., where {$\Omega\Omega\backslash$}Omega is a parametric class of distribution functions, the compactness condition will usually not be fulfilled if no restrictions are imposed on the possible values of the parameters. For example, if {$\Omega\Omega\backslash$}Omega is the class of all univariate normal distributions with unit variance, {$\Omega\Omega\backslash$}Omega is not compact. It is true that by restricting the parameter space to a bounded and closed subset of the unrestricted space, compactness of {$\Omega\Omega\backslash$}Omega will usually be attained. Since such a restriction of the parameter space can frequently be made in applied problems, the condition of compactness may not be too restrictive from the point of view of practical applications. Nevertheless, it seems highly desirable from the theoretical point of view to eliminate or to weaken the condition of compactness of {$\Omega\Omega\backslash$}Omega. This is done in the present paper. The compactness condition is completely omitted in the discrete case (Theorems 2.1-2.5), and replaced by the condition of separability of {$\Omega\Omega\backslash$}Omega in the continuous case (Theorems 3.1-3.4). The latter condition is fulfilled in most of the conventional statistical problems. Another restriction postulated in [3] (Condition 4, p. 297) is the continuity of the weight function W(F,d)W(F,d)W(F, d) in FFF. As explained in section 2.1 of the present paper, the value of W(F,d)W(F,d)W(F, d) is interpreted as the loss suffered when FFF happens to be the true distribution of the chance variables under consideration and the decision ddd is made by the statistician. While the assumption of continuity of W(F,d)W(F,d)W(F, d) in FFF may seem reasonable from the point of view of practical application, it is rather undesirable from the theoretical point of view for the following reasons. It is of considerable theoretical interest to consider simplified weight functions W(F,d)W(F,d)W(F, d) which can take only the values 0 and 1 (the value 0 corresponds to a correct decision, and the value 1 to a wrong decision). Frequently, such weight functions are necessarily discontinuous. Consider, for example, the problem of testing the hypothesis HHH that the mean \texttheta\texttheta\textbackslash theta of a normally distributed chance variable XXX with unit variance is equal to zero. Let d1d1d\_1 denote the decision to accept HHH, and d2d2d\_2 the decision to reject HHH. Assigning the value zero to the weight WWW whenever a correct decision is made, and the value 1 whenever a wrong decision is made, we have: W(\texttheta,d1)=0for\texttheta =0,and=1for\texttheta{$\neq$}0;W(\texttheta,d2)=0for\texttheta{$\neq$}0,and=1for\texttheta =0.W(\texttheta,d1)=0for\texttheta =0,and=1for\texttheta{$\neq$}0;W(\texttheta,d2)=0for\texttheta{$\neq$}0,and=1for\texttheta =0.W(\textbackslash theta, d\_1) = 0 \textbackslash text\{for\} \textbackslash theta = 0, \textbackslash text\{and\} = 1 \textbackslash text\{for\} \textbackslash theta \textbackslash neq 0; W (\textbackslash theta, d\_2) = 0 \textbackslash text\{for\} \textbackslash theta \textbackslash neq 0, \textbackslash text\{and\} = 1 \textbackslash text\{for\} \textbackslash theta = 0. This weight function is obviously discontinuous. In the present paper the main results (Theorems 2.1-2.5 and Theorems 3.1-3.4) are obtained without making any continuity assumption regarding W(F,d)W(F,d)W(F, d). The restrictions imposed in the present paper on the cost function of experimentation are considerably weaker than those formulated in [3]. Condition 5 [3, p. 297] concerning the class {$\Omega\Omega\backslash$}Omega of admissible distribution functions, and condition 7 [3, p. 298] concerning the class of decision functions at the disposal of the statistician are omitted here altogether. One of the new results obtained here is the establishment of the existence of so called minimax solutions under rather weak conditions (Theorems 2.3 and 3.2). This result is a simple consequence of two lemmas (Lemmas 2.4 and 3.3) which seem to be of interest in themselves. The present paper consists of three sections. In the first section several theorems are given concerning zero sum two person games which go somewhat beyond previously published results. The results in section 1 are then applied to statistical decision functions in sections 2 and 3. Section 2 treats the case of discrete chance variables, while section 3 deals with the continuous case. The two cases have been treated separately, since the author was not able to find any simple and convenient way of combining them into a single more general theory.},

When hefted as well as seen, however, bigger objects feel lighter (the size-weight illusion), confirming that the association between visual size and weight has a perceptual component. Darker objects also look heavier than brighter but otherwise identical objects. It is uncertain, however, if this association also has a perceptual element, or if it simply reflects the fact that, in English at least, the same verbal label (light) is applied to both surface brightness and weight. To address this, we looked for a brightness equivalent of the size-weight illusion. Paired-comparison judgements of weight were obtained for balls differing only in color. Based on vision alone, darker objects were judged to be heavier. When the balls were hefted as well as seen, this association was reversed (i.e., a brightness-weight illusion), consistent with it having a perceptual component. To gauge the strength of the illusion (in grams), a white and a black ball (both 129 grams) were each compared against a set of mid-grey balls varying in weight. When the balls were hefted as well as seen, the white ball felt approximately 8 grams heavier than the black ball, a difference corresponding to 6.2\% of their actual weight. Possible environmental origins of the association between surface lightness and weight are considered.},

Most scientific journals practise anonymous peer review. There is no evidence, however, that this is any better than an open system.

Aims
To evaluate the feasibility of an open peer review system.

Method
Reviewers for the British Journal of Psychiatry were asked whether they would agree to have their name revealed to the authors whose papers they review; 408 manuscripts assigned to reviewers who agreed were randomised to signed or unsigned groups. We measured review quality, tone, recommendation for publication and time taken to complete each review.

Results
A total of 245 reviewers (76\%) agreed to sign. Signed reviews were of higher quality, were more courteous and took longer to complete than unsigned reviews. Reviewers who signed were more likely to recommend publication.

Conclusions
This study supports the feasibility of an open peer review system and identifies such a system's potential drawbacks.},

  abstract = {Seven experiments tested whether human navigation depends on enduring representations, or on momentary egocentric representations that are updated as one moves. Human subjects pointed to unseen targets, either while remaining oriented or after they had been disoriented by self-rotation. Disorientation reduced not only the absolute accuracy of pointing to all objects (`heading error') but also the relative accuracy of pointing to different objects (`con\textregistered guration error'). A single light providing a directional cue reduced both heading and con\textregistered guration errors if it was present throughout the experiment. If the light was present during learning and test but absent during the disorientation procedure, however, subjects showed low heading errors (indicating that they reoriented by the light) but high con\textregistered guration errors (indicating that they failed to retrieve an accurate cognitive map of their surroundings). These \textregistered ndings provide evidence that object locations are represented egocentrically. Nevertheless, disorientation had little effect on the coherence of pointing to different room corners, suggesting both (a) that the disorientation effect on representations of object locations is not due to the experimental paradigm and (b) that room geometry is captured by an enduring representation. These \textregistered ndings cast doubt on the view that accurate navigation depends primarily on an enduring, observer-free cognitive map, for humans construct such a representation of extended surfaces but not of objects. Like insects, humans represent the egocentric distances and directions of objects and continuously update these representations as they move. The principal evolutionary advance in animal navigation may concern the number of unseen targets whose egocentric directions and distances can be represented and updated simultaneously, rather than a qualitative shift in navigation toward reliance on an allocentric map. q 2000 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

From a review of meta-analyses, we provide tables of commonly observed effect-sizes across subdisciplines and topic areas in communication and offer these as a guideline for choosing minimum substantial effects ({$\Delta$}) in equivalence testing when no other information source is available. To facilitate the adoption of equivalence tests in future research, we provide easy-to-use custom dialogs for SPSS which greatly simplify their computation and application.},

We show that the complexity of this problem remains NP-complete. Moreover, it is not approximable within some factor. In contrast to this, we develop an efficient greedy algorithm for this problem. Our algorithm is completely distributed, and it assumes that agents have only local knowledge about tasks and resources. We conduct a broad set of experiments to evaluate the performance and scalability of the proposed algorithm in terms of solution quality and computation time. Three different types of networks, namely small-world, random and scale-free networks, are used to represent various social relationships among agents in realistic applications. The results demonstrate that our algorithm works well and also that it scales well to large-scale applications. In addition we consider the same problem in a setting where the agents holding the resources are self-interested. For this, we show how the optimal algorithm can be used to incentivize these agents to be truthful. However, the efficient greedy algorithm cannot be used in a truthful mechanism, therefore an alternative, cluster-based algorithm is proposed and evaluated.},

The average and distribution of 352 effect sizes (analyzed using fixed-effects and random-effects models) was obtained from 133 studies (84 reports) in which word primes were incidentally presented to participants, with a nonopposite control group, before measuring a behavioral dependent variable. Findings revealed a small behavioral priming effect (dFE = 0.332, dRE = 0.352), which was robust across methodological procedures and only minimally biased by the publication of positive (vs. negative) results. Theory testing analyses indicated that more valued behavior or goal concepts (e.g., associated with important outcomes or values) were associated with stronger priming effects than were less valued behaviors. Furthermore, there was some evidence of persistence of goal effects over time. These results support the notion that goal activation contributes over and above perception-behavior in explaining priming effects. In summary, theorizing about the role of value and satisfaction in goal activation pointed to stronger effects of a behavior or goal concept on overt action. There was no evidence that expectancy (ease of achieving the goal) moderated priming effects. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)(journal abstract)},

        Methods~We extract from the spreadsheets, which are provided to users of the analysis (http://www.sportsci.org/), a precise description of how ``magnitude-based inference'' is implemented. We compare the implemented version of the method with general descriptions of it and interpret the method in familiar statistical terms.
        Results and Conclusions~We show that ``magnitude-based inference'' is not a progressive improvement on modern statistics. The additional probabilities introduced are not directly related to the confidence interval but, rather, are interpretable either as P values for two different nonstandard tests (for different null hypotheses) or as approximate Bayesian calculations, which also lead to a type of test. We also discuss sample size calculations associated with ``magnitude-based inference'' and show that the substantial reduction in sample sizes claimed for the method (30\% of the sample size obtained from standard frequentist calculations) is not justifiable so the sample size calculations should not be used. Rather than using ``magnitude-based inference,'' a better solution is to be realistic about the limitations of the data and use either confidence intervals or a fully Bayesian analysis.},

  abstract = {Donald Campbell's approach to causal inference (D. T. Campbell, 1957; W. R. Shadish, T. D. Cook, \& D. T. Campbell, 2002) is widely used in psychology and education, whereas Donald Rubin's causal model (P. W. Holland, 1986; D. B. Rubin, 1974, 2005) is widely used in economics, statistics, medicine, and public health. Campbell's approach focuses on the identification of threats to validity and the inclusion of design features that may prevent those threats from occurring or render them implausible. Rubin's approach focuses on the precise specification of both the possible outcomes for each participant and assumptions that are mathematically sufficient to estimate the causal effect. In this article, the authors compare the perspectives provided by the 2 approaches on randomized experiments, broken randomized experiments in which treatment nonadherence or attrition occurs, and observational studies in which participants are assigned to treatments on an unknown basis. The authors highlight dimensions on which the 2 approaches have different emphases, including the roles of constructs versus operations, threats to validity versus assumptions, methods of addressing threats to internal validity and violations of assumptions, direction versus magnitude of causal effects, role of measurement, and causal generalization. The authors conclude that investigators can benefit from drawing on the strengths of both approaches in designing research.},

  abstract = {Social scientists often seek to demonstrate that a construct has  incremental validity  over and above other related constructs. However, these claims are typically supported by measurement-level models that fail to consider the effects of measurement (un)reliability. We use intuitive examples, Monte Carlo simulations, and a novel analytical framework to demonstrate that common strategies for establishing incremental construct validity using multiple regression analysis exhibit extremely high Type I error rates under parameter regimes common in many psychological domains. Counterintuitively, we find that error rates are highest\textemdash in some cases approaching 100\%\textemdash when sample sizes are large and reliability is moderate. Our findings suggest that a potentially large proportion of incremental validity claims made in the literature are spurious. We present a web application ( http://jakewestfall.org/ivy/ ) that readers can use to explore the statistical properties of these and other incremental validity arguments. We conclude by reviewing SEM-based statistical approaches that appropriately control the Type I error rate when attempting to establish incremental validity.},

  abstract = {Important strides have been made in recent years to promote increasing the reliability and transparency of scientific practice, including the increased availability of open data, and open materials. A major development is the use of preregistered sampling and analysis plans, which enable readers to distinguish between analyses meant to generate versus test theories.. However, these practices have tended to be most immediately applicable to experimental researchers and those who collect new data for each new study. Those whose research involves secondary analysis\textemdash modeling and predicting phenomena using pre-existing datasets\textemdash often believe they are unable to engage in many of these new practices. For example, because the data may have existed for many years, full preregistration is not possible. Nonetheless, there are many ways in which secondary analysts can increase the openness and transparency of their research. Here, we provide nine recommendations for integrating open science practices into analysis of pre-existing data, including being more open about previous work published on the same dataset and registering an analysis plan prior to statistical modeling. These recommendations are expected to be facilitated by a forthcoming registration template on the Open Science Framework. We end by anticipating potential objections to our recommendations.},

In addition, a full Bayesian approach using decision theory to determine optimal sample size is given for INB. The full Bayesian approach, based on the value of information, is proposed in reaction to concerns that traditional methods rely on arbitrarily chosen error probabilities and an ill-defined notion of the smallest clinically important difference. Furthermore, the results of cost-effectiveness studies are used for decision making (e.g. should a new intervention be adopted or the old one retained), and employing decision theory, which permits optimal use of current information and the optimal design of new studies, provides a more consistent approach.},

This article examines the ethics of crowdsourcing in social science research, with reference to my own experience using Amazon's Mechanical Turk. As these types of research tools become more common in scholarly work, we must acknowledge that many participants are not one-time respondents or even hobbyists. Many people work long hours completing surveys and other tasks for very low wages, relying on those incomes to meet their basic needs. I present my own experience of interviewing Mechanical Turk participants about their sources of income, and I offer recommendations to individual researchers, social science departments, and journal editors regarding the more ethical use of crowdsourcing.},

  abstract = {Efforts to increase replication rates in psychology generally consist of recommended improvements to methodology, such as increasing sample sizes to increase power or using a lower alpha level. However, little attention has been paid to how the prior odds (R) that a tested effect is true can affect the probability that a significant result will be replicable. The lower R is, the less likely a published result will be replicable even if power is high. It follows that if R is lower in one set of studies than in another, then all else being equal, published results will be less replicable in the set with lower R. We illustrate this point by presenting an analysis of data from the social-psychology and cognitive-psychology studies that were included in the Open Science Collaboration's (2015) replication project. We found that R was lower for the social-psychology studies than for the cognitive-psychology studies, which might explain why the rate of successful replications differed between these two sets of studies. This difference in replication rates may reflect the degree to which scientists in the two fields value risky but potentially groundbreaking (i.e., low-R) research. Critically, high-R research is not inherently better or worse than low-R research for advancing knowledge. However, if they wish to achieve replication rates comparable to those of high-R fields (a judgment call), researchers in low-R fields would need to use an especially low alpha level, conduct experiments that have especially high power, or both.},

  abstract = {"Written primarily for students and research workers in the area of the behavioral sciences, this book is meant to provide a text and comprehensive reference source on statistical principles underlying experimental design. Particular emphasis is given to those designs that are likely to prove useful in research in the behavioral sciences. The book primarily emphasizes the logical basis of principles underlying designs for experiments rather than mathematical derivations associated with relevant sampling distributions. The topics selected for inclusion are those covered in courses taught by the author during the past several years. Students in these courses have widely varying backgrounds in mathematics and come primarily from the fields of psychology, education, economics, sociology, and industrial engineering. It has been the intention of the author to keep the book at a readability level appropriate for students having a mathematical background equivalent to freshman college algebra. From experience with those sections of the book which have been used as text material in dittoed form, there is evidence to indicate that, in large measure, the desired readability level has been attained. Admittedly, however, there are some sections in the book where this readability goal has not been achieved. The first course in design, as taught by the author, has as a prerequisite a basic course in statistical inference. The contents of Chaps. 1 and 2 review the highlights of what is included in the prerequisite material. These chapters are not meant to provide the reader with a first exposure to these topics. They are intended to provide a review of terminology and notation for the concepts which are more fully developed in later chapters. By no means is all the material included in the book covered in a one semester course. In a course of this length, the author has included Chaps. 3, 4, parts of 5, 6, parts of 7, parts of 10, and parts of 11. Chapters 8 through 11 were written to be somewhat independent of each other. Hence one may read, with understanding, in these chapters without undue reference to material in the others. In general, the discussion of principles, interpretations of illustrative examples, and computational procedures are included in successive sections within the same chapter. However, to facilitate the use of the book as a reference source, this procedure is not followed in Chaps. 5 and 6. Basic principles associated with a large class of designs for factorial experiments are discussed in Chap. 5. Detailed illustrative examples of these designs are presented in Chap. 6. For teaching purposes, the author includes relevant material from Chap. 6 with the corresponding material in Chap. 5. Selected topics from Chaps. 7 through 11 have formed the basis for a second course in experimental design. Relatively complete tables for sampling distributions of statistics used in the analysis of experimental designs are included in the Appendix. Ample references to source materials having mathematical proofs for the principles stated in the text are provided"--Preface.

Guidelines accordingly recommend that the file drawer effect should be eliminated and that statistical significance should not be a criterion in the decision to submit and publish scientific results. By means of a simulation study, we show that selectively publishing effects that differ significantly from the cumulative meta-analytic effect evokes the Proteus phenomenon of poorly replicable and alternating findings. However, the simulation also shows that the selective publication approach yields a scientific record that is content rich as compared to publishing everything, in the sense that fewer publications are needed for obtaining an accurate meta-analytic estimation of the true effect. We conclude that, under the assumption of self-correcting science, the file drawer effect can be beneficial for the scientific collective.},

Part of this work has involved promoting `Registered Reports', wherein journals peer review papers prior to data collection and publication. Although this approach is usually seen as a relatively recent development, we note that a prototype of this publishing model was initiated in the mid-1970s by parapsychologist Martin Johnson in the European Journal of Parapsychology (EJP). A retrospective and observational comparison of Registered and non-Registered Reports published in the EJP during a seventeen-year period provides circumstantial evidence to suggest that the approach helped to reduce questionable research practices. This paper aims both to bring Johnson's pioneering work to a wider audience, and to investigate the positive role that Registered Reports may play in helping to promote higher methodological and statistical standards.},

The field responded with suggestions of how fraud could be prevented. However, the Stapel fraud is only one among many cases. Before basing recommendations on one case, it would be informative to study other cases to assess how these frauds were discovered. The authors analyze a convenience sample of fraud cases to see whether (social) psychology is more susceptible to fraud than other disciplines. They also evaluate whether the peer review process and replications work well in practice to detect fraud. There is no evidence that psychology is more vulnerable to fraud than the biomedical sciences, and most frauds are detected through information from whistleblowers with inside information. On the basis of this analysis, the authors suggest a number of strategies that might reduce the risk of scientific fraud.},

  abstract = {We explored the consequences of ignoring the sampling variation due to stimuli in the domain of implicit attitudes. A large literature in psycholinguistics has examined the statistical treatment of random stimulus materials, but the recommendations from this literature have not been applied to the social psychological literature on implicit attitudes. This is partly because of inherent complications in applying crossed random-effect models to some of the most common implicit attitude tasks, and partly because no work to date has demonstrated that random stimulus variation is in fact consequential in implicit attitude measurement. We addressed this problem by laying out statistically appropriate and practically feasible crossed random-effect models for three of the most commonly used implicit attitude measures\textemdash the Implicit Association Test, affect misattribution procedure, and evaluative priming task\textemdash and then applying these models to large datasets (average N = 3,206) that assess participants' implicit attitudes toward race, politics, and self-esteem. We showed that the test statistics from the traditional analyses are substantially (about 60 \%) inflated relative to the more-appropriate analyses that incorporate stimulus variation. Because all three tasks used the same stimulus words and faces, we could also meaningfully compare the relative contributions of stimulus variation across the tasks. In an appendix, we give syntax in R, SAS, and SPSS for fitting the recommended crossed random-effects models to data from all three tasks, as well as instructions on how to structure the data file.},

Randomized, tightly controlled experiments are enshrined as the gold standard of psychological research, and there are endless investigations of the various mediating and moderating variables that govern various behaviors. We argue that psychology's near-total focus on explaining the causes of behavior has led much of the field to be populated by research programs that provide intricate theories of psychological mechanism but that have little (or unknown) ability to predict future behaviors with any appreciable accuracy. We propose that principles and techniques from the field of machine learning can help psychology become a more predictive science. We review some of the fundamental concepts and tools of machine learning and point out examples where these concepts have been used to conduct interesting and important psychological research that focuses on predictive research questions. We suggest that an increased focus on prediction, rather than explanation, can ultimately lead us to greater understanding of behavior.},

  abstract = {Most theories and hypotheses in psychology are verbal in nature, yet their evaluation overwhelmingly relies on inferential statistical procedures. The validity of the move from qualitative to quantitative analysis depends on the verbal and statistical expressions of a hypothesis being closely aligned\textemdash that is, that the two must refer to roughly the same set of hypothetical observations. Here I argue that most inferential statistical tests in psychology fail to meet this basic condition. I demonstrate how foundational assumptions of the "random effects" model used pervasively in psychology impose far stronger constraints on the generalizability of results than most researchers appreciate. Ignoring these constraints dramatically inflates false positive rates and routinely leads researchers to draw sweeping verbal generalizations that lack any meaningful connection to the statistical quantities they are putatively based on. I argue that the routine failure to consider the generalizability of one's conclusions from a statistical perspective lies at the root of many of psychology's ongoing problems (e.g., the replication crisis), and conclude with a discussion of several potential avenues for improvement.},

Social norms are often sustained by multiple mechanisms, including a desire to coordinate, fear of being sanctioned, signaling membership in a group, or simply following the lead of others. This article shows how stochastic evolutionary game theory can be used to study the resulting dynamics. I illustrate with a variety of examples drawn from economics, sociology, demography, and political science. These include bargaining norms, norms governing the terms of contracts, norms of retirement, dueling, foot binding, medical treatment, and the use of contraceptives. These cases highlight the challenges of applying the theory to empirical cases. They also show that the modern theory of norm dynamics yields insights and predictions that go beyond conventional equilibrium analysis.},

However, contextual factors also exert a top-down influence on emotion detection, privileging particular expressions over others. The current research investigates how the psychological meaning implied by the color red biases the processing of anger expressions. Red has been shown to carry the meaning of threat and danger, and in two experiments we find that exposure to red enhances the perception and identification of anger. In Experiment 1, the identification of anger, relative to happiness, was facilitated when faces were viewed on a red background. In Experiment 2, the red-anger facilitation effect was replicated and shown to not generalize to another high arousal negative emotion, fear. These results document a novel influence of color on emotion detection processes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)(journal abstract)},

When the sample size is large, the observed effect size is a good estimator of the true effect size. One would hope that the post hoc power is also a good estimator of the true power. This article studies whether such a power estimator provides valuable information about the true power., Using analytical, numerical, and Monte Carlo approaches, our results show that the estimated power does not provide useful information when the true power is small. It is almost always a biased estimator of the true power. The bias can be negative or positive. Large sample size alone does not guarantee the post hoc power to be a good estimator of the true power. Actually, when the population variance is known, the cumulative distribution function of the post hoc power is solely a function of the population power. This distribution is uniform when the true power equals 0.5 and highly skewed when the true power is near 0 or 1. When the population variance is unknown, the post hoc power behaves essentially the same as when the variance is known.},

Through re-analyses of Sullivan et al. (2015)'s data and a simulation study, it can be shown that the attribute-angle correlations in the empirical data, which were used to estimate processing speeds, are attributed primarily to their common correlations with choice. The simulation study further suggests that when we account for the choice-mediated attribute-angle correlations, the data patterns used for supporting the original hypothesis can be produced by implementing a plausible alternative mechanism unrelated to processing speeds. The mouse-tracking method therefore fails to provide clear evidence for processing speed difference as a cognitive mechanism of self-control. Researchers should be cautious when using the mouse-tracking method to estimate attribute processing speeds.},

This study investigates variations in emotional responses during movement coordination between a human and a Virtual Partner (VP), an agent whose virtual finger movements are driven by the Haken-Kelso-Bunz (HKB) equations of Coordination Dynamics. Twenty-one subjects were instructed to coordinate finger movements with the VP in either inphase or antiphase patterns. By adjusting model parameters, we manipulated the `intention' of VP as cooperative or competitive with the human's instructed goal. Skin potential responses (SPR) were recorded to quantify the intensity of emotional response. At the end of each trial, subjects rated the VP's intention and whether they thought their partner was another human being or a machine. We found greater emotional responses when subjects reported that their partner was human and when coordination was stable. That emotional responses are strongly influenced by dynamic features of the VP's behavior, has implications for mental health, brain disorders and the design of socially cooperative machines.},

In this article we review theories relevant to lifestyle behavior change from a broader psychology literature, and then integrate these theories to a new theoretical framework called adaptive decision-making to address two specific problems. First, our framework represents lifestyle behaviors at two levels, one of individual daily decisions (action-level), and one of larger behavioral episodes (reflection-level), to more closely match the temporal characteristic of lifestyle behaviors and digital data. Second, the framework connects decision-making theories and learning theories to explain how behaviors and cognitive constructs dynamically influence each other, making it a suitable scaffold for building computational models. We map common digital intervention techniques onto the behavioral and cognitive processes in the framework, and discuss possible contributions of the framework to both theory development and digital intervention design.},

Results revealed larger person-to-person than day-to-day variation in self-control capacity, while its moment-to-moment variation could be weakly modeled as a diurnal pattern. Interindividually, participants with higher self-control capacity were happier and less stressed, but intraindividually higher self-control capacity was mainly associated with higher alertness and energetic arousal. Our results imply that self-control capacity is better conceptualized as a composition of interrelated sub-constructs rather than as a unified resource.},

However, comparisons of correlations still rely heavily on significance testing. The persistence of this practice is caused primarily by the lack of simple yet accurate procedures that can maintain coverage at the nominal level in a nonlopsided manner. The purpose of this article is to present a general approach to constructing approximate confidence intervals for differences between (a) 2 independent correlations, (b) 2 overlapping correlations, (c) 2 nonoverlapping correlations, and (d) 2 independent R2s. The distinctive feature of this approach is its acknowledgment of the asymmetry of sampling distributions for single correlations. This approach requires only the availability of confidence limits for the separate correlations and, for correlated correlations, a method for taking into account the dependency between correlations. These closed-form procedures are shown by simulation studies to provide very satisfactory results in small to moderate sample sizes. The proposed approach is illustrated with worked examples.},

A finding is elevated from single observation to scientific evidence when the procedures that were used to obtain it can be reproduced and the finding itself can be replicated. Recent replication attempts show that some high profile results~\textendash ~most notably in psychology, but in many other disciplines as well~\textendash ~cannot be replicated consistently. These replication attempts have generated a considerable amount of controversy, and the issue of whether direct replications have value has, in particular, proven to be contentious. However, much of this discussion has occurred in published commentaries and social media outlets, resulting in a fragmented discourse. To address the need for an integrative summary, we review various types of replication studies and then discuss the most commonly voiced concerns about direct replication. We provide detailed responses to these concerns and consider different statistical ways to evaluate replications. We conclude there are no theoretical or statistical obstacles to making direct replication a routine aspect of psychological science.},
